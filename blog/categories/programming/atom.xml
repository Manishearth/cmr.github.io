    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome to the third issue of <em>This Week in Rust</em>, a weekly overview
of Rust and its community.</p>

<p>It has come to my attention that Github does not categorize some
merged-by-bors pull requests as &ldquo;merged&rdquo; and instead categorizes it as
&ldquo;closed&rdquo;. This skews the numbers and also the PRs that I looked through for
inclusion into twir. I&rsquo;ll no longer be including issue churn/PR numbers, and I
hope I didn&rsquo;t miss any import PRs in the last two issues.</p>

<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking in incoming?</h1>

<p>The last of the tree breakage has been cleaned up. The mysterious stack
corruption was traced down by Blei to occur in jemalloc. It has been disabled
until the real cause of the error is found. A bunch more buildbot
configurations have been turned on for auto, to fend off more breakage. The
tree is open, and aatch got out a new snapshot!</p>

<p>Most of the work this week is cleanup and preparation for 0.7, but since the
tree has been closed (and the extra auto buildbots lengthen the time it takes
for a PR to be tested for the day it has been open), not much has landed these
past few days, but a bunch happened earlier this week.</p>

<h2>Notable additions, bugfixes, and cleanup</h2>

<ul>
<li>doener made compiles faster by emitting less useless copies and allocations
in <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7259">7259</a></li>
<li>aatch landed <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7124">part 1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7182">part
2</a> of his huge trans refactor
effort, which make trans faster and less terrible.</li>
<li>sully got <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7203">default methods</a>
less broken</li>
<li>yichoi landed a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7128">bunch</a> of
Android fixes.</li>
<li>vadimcn has <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7134">fixed debuginfo</a>,
which is super amazing. This makes it a lot easier for the GSoC student (mw)
to get started.</li>
<li>doener has <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7186">fixed</a> some
pathological behavior in how codegen creates cleanup blocks. This makes the
IR better, reducing compile time, and also allowing better optimization,
reducing binary size.</li>
</ul>


<p><blockquote><p>They reduce compile times by about 10% in total.</p><footer><strong><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7259">https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7259</a></strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p><blockquote><p>Reduces the size of librustc by about 5% and the time required to build<br/>it by about 10%.</p><footer><strong><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7186">https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7186</a></strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p><blockquote><p>The resulting code for rustc is about 13% faster (measured up to and<br/>including the &ldquo;trans&rdquo; pass) and the resulting librustc is about 5%<br/>smaller.</p><footer><strong><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7154">https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7154</a></strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<p>strcat and dbaupp <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7263">continue</a>
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7147">work</a> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7162">with
iterators</a>. The changes that
landed are vector cleanups. Probably most importantly, the <code>each</code> and
<code>eachi</code> methods are being removed. The <code>eachi</code> removal landed but the <code>each</code>
one broke bors, so it&rsquo;s currently in limbo. The current replacement is:</p>

<p><code>
// each
for your_vec.iter().advance |element| {
  ...
}
// eachi
for your_vec.iter().enumerate().advance |(i, element)| {
  ...
}
</code></p>

<p>Once the rest of the iterator work is hashed out and lands, it will just be</p>

<p><code>
// each
for your_vec |element| {
  ...
}
// eachi
for your_vec.enumerate() |(i, element)| {
  ...
}
</code></p>

<p>although the syntax might be slightly different (<code>for element in your_vec</code> is
my favorite proposal).</p>

<h1>Meetings</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Meeting-weekly-2013-06-18">Tuesday
meeting&rsquo;s</a>
main topics were once fn&rsquo;s and how namespaces work. For once fn&rsquo;s, graydon
says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m concerned with adding new features and I want to see if we can live
without it, I understand it is common,&rdquo; not yet making a decision to include
them in the language.</p>

<h1>Meetups</h1>

<ul>
<li>tjc&rsquo;s pre-talk and talk, &ldquo;Rust: A Friendly Introduction&rdquo; went very well. The
<a href="http://catamorphism.org/Writing/Rust-Tutorial-tjc.pdf">slides</a> are up, and
a recording is coming soon (hopefuly). tjc says the slides aren&rsquo;t as
understanable without the audio of the talk.</li>
<li>nmatsakis has expressed willingness/interest in a Boston meetup sometime. If
you&rsquo;re interested, contact him on IRC or the ML.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Notable discourse and external projects</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://maniagnosis.crsr.net/2013/06/mmap-and-rust-foreign-function-interface.html">mmap and the Rust FFI</a>

in next week&rsquo;s twir when it lands)</li>

<h1>Other announcements</h1>

<ul>
<li>Michael Woerister (mw), the GSoC student working on debug info, has begun
work. His project log is at <a href="http://michaelwoerister.github.io/,">http://michaelwoerister.github.io/,</a> and will be
updated weekly. I&rsquo;m looking forward to a much better debug experience.</li>
