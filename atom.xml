    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another 3 months, another release. This is the first release that I&rsquo;ve
witnessed in its entirety! This is a summary of Rust: its compiler,
libraries, documentation, and community. (<a href="http://rust-lang.org">What is
Rust?</a>)</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Compiler</h1>

<p>The compiler is faring well. It received a lot of attention in compile speed,
although memory usage regressed significantly. It is now mostly fixed in
master. Time compiling <code>fn main() { }</code> went from 172ms to 112ms on my box.
When compiling programs of any significance, the gap is much larger. There&rsquo;s
also been some thought put into parallelizing rustc. Michael Woerister&rsquo;s GSoC
project was debuginfo, and it&rsquo;s almost in a fully-working state. As of 0.8,
it&rsquo;s not completely baked &mdash; libstd can&rsquo;t be compiled with it, and stepping
through code isn&rsquo;t perfect &mdash; but it&rsquo;s a huge step forward, and he created an
extensive testsuite, so it shouldn&rsquo;t regress. The pretty printer hasn&rsquo;t seen
much improvement. Default methods, one of the major things Michael Sullivan
worked on over the summer, are in a much better state. If there are any
remaining bugs in them, I haven&rsquo;t seen them.</p>

<h1>Iterators</h1>

<p>Iterators are hugely improved for 0.8. The <code>for</code> loop syntax now uses the
Iterator trait. Additionally, most uses of vector iterators now compile to the
exact same code that indexing or iteration would in C or C++, including the
ability to be vectorized. Additionally, they now use default methods instead
of extension implementations. A bunch of other extensions to Iterator were
added, such as DoubleEndedIterator and RandomAccessIterator.</p>

<h1>Documentation</h1>

<p>The documentation is in a much better state than it was 3 months ago. The new
rustdoc was started and finished. I started it, and Alex Crichton really
polished and finished it the last two weeks before the release. The API
documentation is now navigable, and one can actually see the relationship
between various types. A bunch of work also went into the tutorials, yielding
three new documents: error handling and conditions, iterators and containers,
and rustpkg.</p>

<h1><code>rustpkg</code></h1>

<p>Rustpkg continues to advance. Tim put out the call for community involvement,
and it&rsquo;s getting significant traction in actual libraries. There are still a
few kinks when using it for development, but when just fetching and building
dependencies, it works very well. Servo is porting its whole mini-ecosystem
over to rustpkg, uncovering bunches of problems and deficiencies in the
process. If you&rsquo;re interested in helping out with Rust, rustpkg is a major
area. Tim is also super nice, and will happily help you get into the codebase.</p>

<h1>Libraries</h1>

<p>Rust is slowly accreting more and more useful libraries: mostly coming from
the gamedev community, but sometimes other useful things as well. The
new runtime has completely replaced the old, a significant step forward for
Rust&rsquo;s maturity. <code>rust-http</code> is making some really nice strides, as well as
the opengl bindings. The standard libraries are becoming nicer to use.
<code>std::run</code>, in particular, stands out to me as something that&rsquo;s quite easy to
use, and <code>std::str</code> saw a lot of work making it more correct.</p>

<h1>The Future</h1>

<p>This was a great release cycle, and I think the next one will be even better.
Alex Crichton was hired as a full-time Rust developer, and he has been doing a
lot of important work that just would have taken a while to happen otherwise.
I&rsquo;m very optimistic about this release, much more so than 0.7. I think we
might be able to hit milestone 1 for 0.9 or 0.10, though that&rsquo;s just
speculation on my part.</p>

<h1>Is Rust Ready?</h1>

<p>No. Rust is approaching maturity, but it isn&rsquo;t there yet. There are still
backwards-incompatible changes being made to try and get to milestone 2.  The
major things that come to mind are closure reform and privacy overhaul (which
is being worked on in master <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9735">right
now</a>). Additionally, people in the
gamedev community are starting to hit walls with the type system. Those
probably won&rsquo;t be fixed in the time leading up to 1.0, but this is also
speculation.</p>

<p>Experimenting with Rust is becoming more viable as time goes on, but using it
in production is a bad idea, especially if &ldquo;low maintenance&rdquo; is at all
valuable.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking on master?</h1>

<p>Only 63 PRs were merged this week. Currently in the queue is the massive
privacy change, the path rewrite, enum descriminant shrinking, a <code>rand</code>
rework, a lock-free scheduler message queue, and libuv signal bindings.</p>

<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>float</code> has been <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9519">removed from the
language</a>.</li>
<li><code>loop</code> has been <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9665">removed</a>. The
transition to <code>continue</code> is complete.</li>
<li>A macro ignoring tokens now <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9673">throws an
error</a> rather than silently
ignoring it.</li>
<li><code>IntConvertible</code> has been
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9250">replaced</a> with <code>ToPrimitive</code> and
<code>FromPrimitive</code>. This also heralds the ability to derive to/from int methods
on enums.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Everything Else</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>rustpkg</code> can <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9741">fetch remote packages
again</a>.</li>
<li>A bunch of unsafe code surrounding logging <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9593">has been
remove</a>.</li>
<li>A bunch of work was done to make more things immediate. A
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9643">bugfix</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9656">small
tuples</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9677">small
enums</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9699">unit/C-like
enums</a>.</li>
<li>A bunch of work went into decreasing our memory usage. The massive spike at
the beginning <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9612">has been fixed</a>.
The tcx (type context, holds the result of <em>all</em> compiler analysis) is also
free&rsquo;d before translation now, reducing memory usage by a good <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9686">500+
MB</a>. Another cache during
constant evaluation <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9722">reduces memory usage by
200MB</a>.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re now <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9662">bundling our
dependencies</a> on Windows, making
it easier to bootstrap and to setup a working Rust environment.</li>
<li>All of the really old obsolete syntax checkers <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9712">have been
removed</a>.</li>
<li>Hyperlinking between crates is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9691">now
reimplemented</a> in rustdoc.</li>
<li>Gearing up for its removal, <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9599">all <code>fmt!</code> usage in the compiler has been
removed</a>.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to another issue of <em>This Week in Rust</em>! This week saw the release of
0.8, the removal of <code>@fn</code>, and a bunch of other changes. The tutorial has been
updated significantly, surrounding pointers and boxes, so you should re-read
those sections if you&rsquo;re still feeling shaky on when you should use which.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking on master?</h1>

<p>There were 79 PRs merged this week.</p>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>printf!</code> and <code>printfln!</code> have been
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9550">removed</a>.</li>
<li><code>continue</code> is now a keyword, a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9504">synonym for

removal (<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/9467">https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/9467</a>)</li>

<li><code>impl Foo for T;</code> is now <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9336">disallowed</a>.
Use <code>impl Foo for T {}</code>.</li>
<li><code>@fn</code> has been <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9310">removed from the

<li><code>start</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9301">no longer takes a crate
map</a>.</li>
<li>Some more keywords have been
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9389">reserved</a>: <code>alignof</code>,
<code>offsetof</code>, and <code>sizeof</code>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Everything else</h2>

<ul>
<li>A ton of documentation work was put in this week. The box section of the
tutorial has been <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9589">rewritten</a>,
and there&rsquo;s a new <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9439">rustpkg
tutorial</a> too. The module
tutorial saw the file section
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9398">extended</a>. There was a bunch of
module documentation updated/added too.</li>
<li>rustdoc(_ng) also saw a lot of work. It <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9402">completely
replaced</a> the old rustdoc, as
well as seeing a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9577">lot</a> of
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9475">fixes</a>. Huge thanks to Alex
Crichton for all the work with it!</li>
<li><code>std::vec</code> has seen some <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9583">nice
changes</a> to <code>connect_vec</code> and
<code>concat_vec</code> (they were really awful before).</li>
<li><code>rustpkg test</code> is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9549">implemented</a>.</li>
<li><code>type_use</code> has been <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9538">removed</a>.
This did some nasty things and LLVM&rsquo;s <code>mergefunc</code> pass will do a better job
of the same optimization (once it&rsquo;s enabled).</li>
<li><code>with_c_str</code> is now <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9352">optimized</a>
to be allocation-free for short vectors.</li>
<li>The logging system, when using the new formatting code (so <code>debug2</code> etc) is
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9261">allocation-free</a>.</li>
<li><code>std::rand</code> has seen some
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9362">cleanup</a>, in preparation for its
overhaul.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to another issue of <em>This Week in Rust</em>. We&rsquo;re gearing up for a 0.8
release, tentatively planned for Thursday. Additionally, a huge welcome of
Alex Crichton to the Rust team! He&rsquo;s been doing some great work, it&rsquo;s
wonderful to have another full-time Rust dev.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking in master?</h1>

<p>There were 86 PRs merged this week.</p>

<h2>rustdoc_ng</h2>

<p>rustdoc_ng was merged into mainline and enabled as the new rustdoc, in time
for 0.8. This makes me incredibly happy, as it marks the conclusion of my
quest to a better rustdoc. Not to say that rustdoc is finished or perfect,
but it&rsquo;s already much better than the old rustdoc. My sincere thanks go to
Jordi Boggiano (Seldaek), who worked unceasingly to create a beautiful,
usable frontend, and to Meret Vollenweider (meretv) for donating her amazing
design skills. Also thanks to Huon Wilson (dbaupp) for moral support and
creating the awesome DocFolder interface that passes over the documentation
use. And, of course, to Alex Crichton, who pushed these past few days to port
the static site generator to Rust and to integrate it into the build system.</p>

<p>The new docs have replaced the old docs. You can view them <a href="http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/index.html">on the Rust
website</a>. Still to-do
is proper cross-crate doc hyperlinking. To run it on your own crate, build a
recent Rust and do <code>rustdoc html path/to/your/crate.rs</code>. It will eventually be
integrated into <code>rustpkg</code>.</p>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>extra::par</code> has been <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9380">removed</a>.</li>
<li>Some unsound functional struct updates (FSU, <code>{a: 5, ..b}</code>) <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9350">are now
disallowed</a>.</li>
<li><code>--cfg debug</code> is no longer required. If you want to disable debug logging,
use <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9278"><code>--cfg ndebug</code></a>.</li>
<li>The various uses of <code>NaN</code> are now <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9321">lowercased to
<code>nan</code></a>.</li>
<li><code>std::util::unreachable</code> has been removed in factor of the
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9320"><code>unreachable!</code></a> macro.</li>
<li><code>extra::future</code> has been <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9285">cleaned
up</a> a bit, including some method
shuffling/renames.</li>
<li><code>extra::getopts</code> has been <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9267">cleaned
up</a> as well, with most free
functions now being methods.</li>
<li>The <code>from_str</code> methods in the numeric modules have been
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9275">removed</a> in favor of the FromStr
trait and the <code>from_str</code> free function in the prelude. Same for
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9209"><code>from_str_radix</code></a>.</li>
<li>The <code>Drop</code> trait now uses <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9244"><code>&amp;mut
self</code></a>, as part of the transition
to by-value drops.</li>
<li><code>extra::json</code> uses a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9231">different
encoding</a> when encoding/decoding
enums, so any Rust-generated JSON before this patch will now be rejected by
the decoder.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Other changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>debuginfo now works for <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9168">recursive
types</a>.</li>
<li>You can now <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9213">pass parameters</a> to
the generated test with <code>rust test</code>.</li>
<li><code>extern fn</code>s from external crates now use the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9196">declared
ABI</a>, rather than assuming cdecl.</li>
<li><code>CString</code> has gained an
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9220"><code>as_str</code></a> method.</li>
<li>Some <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9108">overflow bugs</a> in <code>vec</code> and
<code>str</code> have been fixed.</li>
<li><code>statics</code> are now <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9130">properly
inlined</a> cross-crate.</li>
<li>The <code>bytes!</code> macro&rsquo;s error reporting has been <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9245">tightened
up</a> to make it more obvious where
the error is.</li>
<li><code>rustpkg init</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9236">has been added</a>,
to create a new workspace.</li>
<li>File IO in newrt has been <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9235">massively
reworked</a> and is much more
complete than the oldrt.</li>
<li>The exact meaning of &ldquo;unsafety&rdquo; <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9258">is now
documented</a>.</li>
<li><code>\0</code> escapes in strings <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9248">is now
supported</a>.</li>
<li><code>rustpkg</code> now thinks in terms of crates, not packages, to you can now have
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9263">multiple crates in a single
package</a> and have things work
correctly.</li>
<li>newrt has <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9260/files">pipes and process
support</a> now.</li>
<li><code>format!</code> now allows <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9299">trailing
commas</a> in its arguments.</li>
<li>The lexer now throws <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9308">vastly better
errors</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Weekly Meeting</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Meeting-weekly-2013-09-17">weekly
meeting</a>
discussed quite a bit, most interesting to me was the crypto discussion,
putting <code>macro_rules!</code> behind an experimental flag, and the default arguments
discussion.</p>

<li>Some <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9062">more free functions</a> have
been removed from <code>std::vec</code>. <code>unzip</code> now takes an iterator, a
<code>Permutations</code> iterator has been added, and some rarely-used, obsolete,
functions were removed.</li>
<li>A bunch of changes to <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9115">were
made</a>. Specifically, <code>chain</code> was
changed to <code>and_then</code> and <code>unwrap_or_default</code> to <code>unwrap_or</code>.</li>
<li>rustpkg <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9151">builds into
target-specific</a> subdirectories
now.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Additions and fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>debuginfo now has <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9097">namespace
support</a>. Looking at all the
various PRs Michael has opened over the summer, it seems DWARF is a very
flexible, nice debuginfo format, but gdb and LLVM don&rsquo;t support it very
well.</li>
<li>Correct <code>range_step</code> and <code>range_step_inclusive</code> iterators <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9199">have been
added</a>. They are correct in cases
of overflow, and are generic.</li>
<li>A handy <code>sleep</code> function <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9191">has been
added</a> to newrt.</li>
<li>File IO in newrt <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9165">works on
windows</a> now.</li>
<li>A bug where nested items in a default method weren&rsquo;t compiled <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9162">has been
fixed</a>.</li>
<li>A rendezvous concurrency structure, much like Ada&rsquo;s, <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8908">has been
added</a>.</li>
<li>Buffered IO wrappers <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9091">have been
added</a>.</li>
<li>nmatsakis landed a PR that <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9088">closed 7 issues at
once</a>.</li>
<li>rustpkg now uses <code>extra::workcache</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9034">to prevent recompilation of
already-compiled crates</a>.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to another <em>This Week in Rust</em>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking in master?</h1>

<p>65 pull requests were merged this week, and bors has had some idle time when
there wasn&rsquo;t anything approved in the queue.</p>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>std::os::glob</code> has been replaced with a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8914">pure Rust
version</a>, for cross-platform and
compatability reasons.</li>
<li><code>std::str::from_bytes</code> has been
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8997">renamed</a> to
<code>std::str::from_utf8</code>, to be explicit about what it accepts.</li>
<li>Casting to bool with <code>as</code> is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8980">no longer
allowed</a>, and surrogate
characters are no longer allowed in strings.</li>
<li>char is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8974">no longer</a> treated as an
integer type (meaning it can&rsquo;t be casted to/from them), which removes the
ability for safe code to create invalid characters.</li>
<li>Opening a listening socket and actually listening on it <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8954">have been
split</a>. If you&rsquo;re jiggy with the
jive, listen and accept are now separate operations. (<em>ed</em>: this used to say
bind and accept wereseparate; thanks to ecr for the correction.)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Additions</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>let</code> var hygiene has <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9026">landed</a>.
I&rsquo;m sure this has cool implications, but I don&rsquo;t really know what they are.</li>
<li>An <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8903"><code>export_name</code> attribute</a> has
been added to control what symbol name something is exported as (similar to
<code>no_mangle</code>).</li>
<li>An <code>ExactSize</code> trait <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8884">has been
added</a> to mark an iterator that
always accurately reports its size in the <code>size_hint</code> method.</li>
<li><code>ToStr</code> has been <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8960">implemented</a>
for char and Ascii.</li>
<li>Safe accessors of <code>MutexArc</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8966">have been
implemented</a></li>
<li>A bytes iterator <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8935">has been added</a>
for newrt readers.</li>
<li>Stream is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8984">automatically
implemented</a> for types which
implement Reader and Writer from newrt.</li>
<li>An <code>unreachable</code> macro <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8992">has been
added</a> for better error reporting
than a function could do.</li>
<li>newrt <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9000">can now do</a> simple DNS
resolution.</li>
<li>strptime/strftime <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9016">now support</a>
fractional seconds, out to tenths of a nanosecond.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Changes etc</h2>

<ul>
<li>Name mangling <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8875">has been
improved</a>.</li>
<li><code>rust_log.cpp</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8880">has been
converted</a> into pure Rust.</li>
<li>Debuginfo <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8855">now does closure
capture</a> and very large structs.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8947">bunch</a>
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8927">of</a>
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8928">repr</a> improvements landed.</li>
</ul>

on the Json enum</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8558"><code>XorShiftRng::new()</code> now uses a random

<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8619">3</a>,

</ul>


<p>Congratulations to them all. The interns did a ton of great work over the
summer.</p>

<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking on master?</h1>

<p>There were only 46 PRs merged this week. I don&rsquo;t quite know why that number is
so low this week. It certainly wasn&rsquo;t for lack of PRs: the queue has been
constantly backlogged. Issue churn was -26, yay!</p>

<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8526">Some functions in Result and Either were replaced to work with external
iterators</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8423">The <code>priv</code> and <code>pub</code> visibility modifiers are now forbidden on contexts
where they have no meaning</a>. For
example, marking a struct field <code>pub</code>, or a module <code>priv</code>. The compiler
errors for this are quite informative, and the conversion is purely
mechanical.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8532"><code>to_c_str</code> now raises a condition if the string contains interior <code>NUL</code>s,
as it is impossible to create a valid C string with interior
<code>NUL</code>s</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Library improvments, bugfixes, and cleanup</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8446"><code>ifmt!</code>, the new formatter, has been
finished</a>. Yay!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8453"><code>extra::stats::write_boxplot</code> now works with negative or zero sample
values</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8452">Some missing pieces in libstd have been filled
in</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8491">A <code>sample</code> method has been added to <code>RngUtil</code>, for resevior
sampling</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Compiler improvements, bugfixes, and cleanup</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8527">A ton of work was done on a new
visitor</a>. This is the first of a
series of five.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8483">Vector repeat exprs (<code>[0, ..16]</code>) are now allowed in
statics</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8477">A hint has been added for incorrect use of static
methods</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8497">Trait object coercion to <code>&amp;Trait</code> has been fixed to handle freezing and
reborrowing more correctly</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8329">Debuginfo of lexical scopes and variable shadowing has been massively
improved</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8410">A <code>--target-cpu</code> flag has been added to select the target CPU, rather than
always using &ldquo;generic&rdquo;</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8455">Support for owned and borrowed trait objects has been made better
added</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8421">An <code>address_insignificant</code> attribute has been
added</a>. LLVM will do merging of
statics marked with that attribute.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8408">Intrinsics for checked overflow on add, sub, and mul have been
added</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Tools, documentation, etc</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8469">The tutorial was translated into
Japanese</a>. I think this is the
first translation of anything, so it&rsquo;s a pretty big milestone I think.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://cmr.github.io/blog/2013/08/13/rust-by-concept/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-13T01:14:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://cmr.github.io/blog/2013/08/13/rust-by-concept</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Note:</strong> I accidentally published this. I won&rsquo;t take it down, but it is
incomplete and I do not guarantee its correctness.</p>

<p>Rust seems to intimidate newcomers, as its memory model is fairly complex. I
think part of the problem is that the language tutorial introduces the memory
model by feature.  Rather, I&rsquo;ll introduce it by concept, showing examples of
code that breaks memory safety in C, and how Rust&rsquo;s memory model prevents the
error. Hopefully I can convince you that Rust isn&rsquo;t as complex as it looks,
and that the extra syntax is well-worth the zero-cost memory safety. I&rsquo;ll be
comparing Rust code to equivalent C idioms using the <a href="http://zeromq.org/"><code>zeromq
library</code></a> because it has a very clean API in both
languages. As such, I assume basic familiarity with C. Rust is not a very
suitable language for new programmers, and neither is this tutorial.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The core concepts driving Rust&rsquo;s memory management are, in reverse order of
simplicity, <em>ownership</em>, <em>mutability</em>, and <em>lifetime</em>. It&rsquo;s not that other
languages don&rsquo;t have them, it&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re implicit or convention. I
won&rsquo;t be using many fancy features of Rust here. They aren&rsquo;t needed to explain
the memory management, variables and functions suffice.</p>

<h1>Ownership</h1>

<p>Ownership is simply who is responsibile for freeing an object. If you own an
object, you are ensured it is valid.</p>

<p>An example in C would be:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>void *context = zmq_ctx_new(); // zeromq owns the context, you just get to use it
</span><span class='line'>// ...
</span><span class='line'>zmq_ctx_destroy(context); // you need to tell zeromq to free it, you aren't allowed to do so</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In Rust:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>let context: ~Context = zmq_ctx_new();
</span><span class='line'>// ....
</span><span class='line'>// context implicitly freed when no one owns it anymore</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Notice that the C uses an opaque <code>void*</code> and that Rust uses
the explicitly-named <code>~Context</code>. In C, you often use opaque types because the
language offers no control over visibility of struct members. In Rust, you can
mark the fields of a struct <code>priv</code>, which will disallow users of the library
from using those fields. This is a bit nuanced, and I&rsquo;ll explain it in a later
tutorial on privacy and the module system.</p>

<p>The tilde means &ldquo;owned pointer&rdquo;, in that if you have an owned pointer to an
object, you are the owner. Creating an owned pointer involves a heap
allocation (malloc). I use an owned pointer in these examples to mirror the C,
but idiomatic Rust uses values on the stack much more frequently than values
on the heap.</p>

<h2>Taking ownership</h2>

<p>Rust goes one step further with ownership. The compiler asserts that an object
cannot be owned multiple times. An object can be owned by a stack frame
(locals and function arguments), a scope, or a struct. For lack of a better
term, I&rsquo;ll call these &ldquo;owners.&rdquo; You transfer ownership by &ldquo;moving&rdquo; into an
owner. Once an owner loses ownership, the compiler will error if you try to
use the object again through that owner.  This disallows dangling pointers and
prevents an entire class of error (and potentially vulnerability), &ldquo;use after
free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In C, it&rsquo;s perfectly valid to do:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>void *context = zmq_ctx_new();
</span><span class='line'>zmq_ctx_destroy(context);
</span><span class='line'>use_context(context); // compiles fine, but clearly incorrect</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Whereas in Rust:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>let context: ~Context = zmq_ctx_new();
</span><span class='line'>{ // introduce a scope
</span><span class='line'>  let context2: ~Context = context; // context moved into the variable in this scope
</span><span class='line'>} // context2 freed at scope close
</span><span class='line'>use_context(context); // error: use of moved value: `context`</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Not taking ownership</h2>

<p>Most functions that take arguments don&rsquo;t need to take ownership. To express
this, Rust has the &ldquo;borrowed pointer.&rdquo; For example, in C you would write this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>int length(some_large_struct_t *datum) {
</span><span class='line'>  return datum-&gt;x - datum-&gt;padding;
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The function does not care who owns the object, it doesn&rsquo;t need to free it, as
there&rsquo;s no reason the object can&rsquo;t be used again after this computation. In
Rust, it&rsquo;s:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>fn length(datum: &some_large_struct) -&gt; int {
</span><span class='line'>  datum.x - datum.padding
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The first thing you&rsquo;ll notice is that there is no dereference to be found in
the source. In C, <code>-&gt;</code> is the dereferencing struct member extraction operator.
In Rust, <code>.</code> will dereference if it needs to. You&rsquo;ll also notice that Rust
uses <code>&amp;</code> rather than <code>*</code> to indicate this type of a pointer. It&rsquo;s the same
operator used to take a pointer (address-of), as in C. C, however, doesn&rsquo;t
enforce the non-transfer of ownership. It&rsquo;s perfectly valid to do:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>int length(some_large_struct_t *datum) {
</span><span class='line'>  int l = datum-&gt;x - datum-&gt;padding;
</span><span class='line'>  free(datum);
</span><span class='line'>  return l;
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><code>length</code> has now incorrectly taken ownership of <code>datum</code>, by <code>free</code>ing it. Any
code which had a pointer to <code>datum</code> has now been rendered incorrect. In Rust,
there is no way to safely free memory. It is automatically free&rsquo;d.</p>

<h2>Multiple ownership</h2>

<p>There are situations when ownership isn&rsquo;t so black and white, and for that
Rust has the &ldquo;managed pointer.&rdquo; The type of a managed pointer is <code>@'static T</code>.
The <code>'static</code> means &ldquo;this type cannot contain any borrowed pointers.&rdquo; The
shorthand for <code>@'static T</code> is just <code>@T</code>: it&rsquo;s impossible to have a managed
pointer to a type that doesn&rsquo;t fulfill <code>'static</code>. Using only owned and
borrowed pointers, ownership forms a DAG. Managed pointers allow cycles. They
are GC-managed, and allow multiple pointers to the same object. The way this
is enabled is that the pointer&rsquo;s contents (the pointee) are immutable. If
they were allowed to be mutable, data races would occur. In the next section
I&rsquo;ll show the mutable version.</p>

<p>These have no direct comparison in C. The closest comparison is probably
GObject&rsquo;s memory management API. Managed pointers aren&rsquo;t explicit memory
management. As the name suggests, the runtime manages it for you. Managed
pointers are usually considered as a &ldquo;last resort&rdquo;. Even though GC in Rust can
be fast because all managed pointers are task-local, no GC is always faster
than some GC.</p>

<h1>Mutability</h1>

<p>Mutability is whether you are allowed to mutate, or modify, some data. There
are two pieces to mutability: mutability of things an object owns (inherited
mutability), and mutability of data through a pointer.</p>

<h2>Inherited Mutability</h2>

<p>Say you have a point on the stack:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>struct Point {
</span><span class='line'>  x: int,
</span><span class='line'>  y: int
</span><span class='line'>}
</span><span class='line'>let value: Point = Point { x: 24, y: 42 };</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you try to mutate the point by, say, changing the <code>x</code> field, the compiler
will complain:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>value.x = 42; //~ ERROR: cannot assign to immutable field</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The error message is actualy a bit misleading: there is no such thing as a
mutable field! &ldquo;Point&rdquo; is said to have inherited mutability; its mutability is
determined by the mutability of the thing that holds it. So, to fix this
example, we&rsquo;d use:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>let mut value: Point = Point { x: 24, y: 42 };
</span><span class='line'>value.x = 42;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Inherited mutability inherits throughout the ownership tree: the value, and
everything the value owns, recursively.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome to the tenth issue of <em>This Week in Rust</em>. This week marks
the enabling of the new runtime written entirely in Rust. A lot happens every
week, so I&rsquo;m going to start omitting PRs that I deem of lesser importance.
This process is entirely arbitrary, don&rsquo;t feel hurt if I exclude your PR :).</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking on <code>master</code>?</h1>

<p>Issue churn was -12 this week. A total of 70 PRs were merged.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8358">The new runtime has been enabled by
default</a>. This is the culmination
of a lot of work by brson and the rt interns (toddaaro, bblum, and ecr being
the ones I know of). It&rsquo;s written entirely in Rust, and lives in <code>std::rt</code>.
Additionally, the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8387">old C++ runtime has been
removed</a>.</p>

<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8296"><strong>Trailing nulls have been removed from all string
types.</strong></a>. This will break your
FFI code in subtle and mysterious ways, if you didn&rsquo;t explicitly use the
<code>as_c_str</code> methods. FFI code using the new <code>str::c_str</code> code will be more
robust, as it forbids interior nulls, and ensures that a trailing null
always exists. The replacement for <code>str.as_c_str</code> is
<code>str.to_c_str().as_slice()</code>, from what I can tell.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cmr/rust/commit/e99eff172a11816f335153147dd0800fc4877bee">The <code>priv</code> keyword is no longer allowed where it has no
meaning</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8265"><code>iter</code> and <code>iter_err</code> in Result have been replaced with external
iterators</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8288">The <code>get</code> method of <code>Option</code>, <code>Either</code>, and <code>Result</code> has been removed in
favor of <code>unwrap</code></a>. They both did
the same thing, which was useless duplication.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8218"><code>std::gc</code> and <code>std::stackwalk</code></a>
have been removed, as they are obsolete with the new runtime.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8264">The transitionary <code>foreach</code> has been
removed</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Notable library additions, bugfixes, and cleanup</h2>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome to the ninth issue of <em>This Week in Rust</em>. This week brings
the new <code>for</code> loop, which is very exciting, as well as a bunch of runtime
changes and cleanup.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking on <code>master</code>?</h1>

<p>Issue churn was +4 this week. A total of 63 PRs were merged (again).</p>

<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>The <code>for</code> loop now uses external iterators.</strong> This means any code written
to use the old internal iterator protocol will no longer work. See the
<a href="http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial-container.html">iterator tutorial</a>
for more information on how to use it. Related pull requests:
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8141">#8141</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8184">#8184</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8190">#8190</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8244">#8244</a>. A few uses now
require <code>do</code> rather than <code>for</code> because they cannot/have not been
implemented in terms of external iterators.</li>
<li><code>unsafe</code> is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8235">no longer allowed</a>
for functions in <code>extern</code> blocks: they are all unsafe.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8175"><code>extra::dbg</code> module</a> has
been removed.</li>
<li><code>uint::range</code> and all its friends have been replaced with an <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8216">external
iterator</a>, that is in the
prelude. Code like the following now works:
<code>
for x in range(0, 10) {
    println(x.to_str());
}
</code></li>
<li>The pipes compiler (the thing driving <code>proto!</code>) <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8170">has been
removed</a>, as it saw limited
use, was very old, and was a significant maintenance burden.</li>
<li><code>PortSet</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8164">has been removed</a> from
std, as the new scheduler does not support it.</li>
<li>A bunch of old task APIs <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8139">have been
removed</a>, aslo in preparation for
the new schduler.</li>
<li><code>is_utf8</code> now <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8133">rejects overlong
encodings</a>.</li>
<li>The iterator adaptors <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8090">no longer have the Iterator
suffix</a>, same with <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8095">str and vec
iterators</a> as well.</li>
</ul>


<h2>newrt changes</h2>

<p>A bunch of newrt things landed this week, so it gets its own section.</p>

<ul>
<li>Some <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8234">bugs preventing the arc and sync tests from
passing</a> have been fixed.</li>
<li>The new scheduler now supports <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8221">the <code>SingleThreaded</code> spawn
mode</a>.</li>
<li>A bunch of work with task killing <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8195">has
landed</a>.</li>
<li>Some <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8116">major TLS changes</a> also
landed.</li>
<li>Tasks can <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8158">now be named</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8008"><code>select</code> on newrt pipes</a> has
been implemented.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Notable library additions, bugfixes, and cleanup</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>Map::contains_key</code> is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8246">now a default
method</a> implemented in terms of
<code>Map::find</code></li>
<li>A <code>dynamic_lib</code> segfault <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8219">has been
fixed</a>.</li>
<li>A keyed <code>HashMap</code> constructor is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8186">now
exposed</a> for runtimeless programs
that want to use it.</li>
<li>The <code>Str</code> trait now has an <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8204"><code>into_owned</code>
method</a> to avoid copies when you
already have a <code>~str</code>.</li>
<li>A bunch of <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8174">SHA1 and SHA2
cleanup/optimizations</a> landed. I
hear that the speed is almost optimal, only a few cycles/byte short of
Intel&rsquo;s optimized implementation.</li>
<li>Errno coverage has been <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8193">significantly expanded for
Linux</a>. I added all of the ones
that were missing, at least the ones that were present on my system.</li>
<li><code>assert!()</code> without a message <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8150">now does less
allocation</a>.</li>
<li>&lsquo;\&rsquo; is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8138">no longer treated as a path
separater</a> on POSIX system.</li>
<li><code>getopt</code>&rsquo;s <code>opts_str</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8135">has been corrected to use more than just the first
element of the vector</a>.</li>
<li>Some more methods <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8115">were added</a> in
<code>std::num</code>.</li>
<li>An iterator over the offsets of each character in a string <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8082">was
added</a>.</li>
<li>A bunch of <code>RandomAccessIterator</code> implementations <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8120">have been
added</a>.</li>
<li><code>Clone</code> and <code>DeepClone</code> are <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8109">now
implemented</a> for <code>extern "Rust"
fn</code>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Notable compiler additions, bugfixes, and cleanup</h2>

<ul>
<li>A <code>cfg!</code> syntax extension <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8188">has been
added</a> for conditionally running
code based on crate configuration, similar to what <code>#[cfg]</code> does for
conditional compilation. It expands into a true/false constant, so LLVM
should optimize out the dead branches.</li>
<li>Some more codegen tests <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8165">have been
added</a>.</li>
<li><code>copy</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8162">has been removed as a
keyword</a>.</li>
<li>Static struct initializers <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8091">can now contain
<code>..base</code></a> for functional update.</li>
<li>Take glue <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8146">has been unified</a> for
unique pointer type.</li>
<li>Pointer arithmetic is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8121">now implemented with
GEP</a> rather than casting to int
and back to the pointer.</li>
<li>Some more AST types <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8107">were
renamed</a>.</li>
<li>Cross-crate conditions <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8185">now
work</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Documentation, tools, and other stuff</h2>

<ul>
<li>LLVM assertions <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8147">can now be
disabled</a> with a configure
option.</li>
<li>Benchmarking can <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8111">now be
disabled</a> by passing <code>NO_BENCH=1</code>
to make.</li>
<li><code>NO_REBUILD</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8110">no longer requires a
re-boostrap</a>, which should make
debug cycles on libstd much shorter.</li>
<li><code>vec</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7223">now has module
documentation</a>.</li>
<li>rustpkg <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8032">now handles tags</a>, and
not just version numbers, in the package ID.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Meetings</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Meeting-weekly-2013-07-23">Tuesday
meeting</a> was
quite productive. A quick summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>Graydon wants to investigate using the Memory Pool System as the Rust GC,
rather than a bespoke one. The <a href="http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/">MPS</a> is
a very mature and robust memory management library.</li>
<li>The buildbots now collect and report some metrics as JSON. Take a poke in
<code>http://static.rust-lang.org/build-metrics/&lt;git-sha1&gt;/&lt;builder&gt;/&lt;slave&gt;/&lt;metricsfile&gt;.json</code>
if you&rsquo;re interested.</li>
<li>pcwalton proposes allowing <code>Self</code> in impls, like in trait definitions.</li>
<li>There was some discussion of destructors taking <code>self</code> by value.</li>
<li>There was a proposal to remove <code>*mut</code>, but it can be useful. There was no
consensus.</li>
<li>There was also some discussion on closures and mutable captures. I don&rsquo;t
really have enough context to understand the conversation, something to do
with &ldquo;thunks&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Removing <code>&amp;const</code> was discussed as well. The &ldquo;plan is that we add a lint
flag but document it as a reserved word&rdquo;, as it doesn&rsquo;t really seem to be
useful.</li>
</ul>

overview of Rust and its community. Things are calming down quite a bit, in
that nothing extraordinarily exciting is happening. Lots of great work is
being done everywhere, and good progress is being made in both bugfixes and
cleanup. It has been a good week!</p>

<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking on master?</h1>

<p>Issue churn this week was -15. A total of 59 PRs were merged.</p>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7684">The semantics of <code>range_rev</code> have
changed</a>. This will break your
code without warning.</strong> It is now, to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28mathematics%29#Notations_for_intervals">interval
notation</a>,
<code>(hi, lo]</code> rather than <code>[hi, lo)</code>.</li>
<li><code>pub extern</code> and <code>priv extern</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7896">have been
removed</a> from the language. This
matches the previous similar change to <code>impl</code>. Place the visibility
qualifier (<code>pub</code>/<code>priv</code>) on each item in the <code>extern</code> block instead.</li>
<li><code>&amp;T</code> (besides <code>&amp;'static T</code>) is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7894">no longer allowed in
<code>@T</code></a>.</li>
<li>The <code>ThreadPerCore</code> spawn mode <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7856">has been
removed</a>, as it doesn&rsquo;t make
sense with the new scheduler.</li>
<li>The <code>consume</code> methods of the hash containers <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7833">has been replaced with an
external iterator</a>. The method
name is the same, though.</li>
<li>Moved values can <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7849">no longer be captured
twice</a>. This was a blatant
soundness issue.</li>
<li>The <code>swap_unwrap</code> method of Option has been <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7831">renamed to
<code>take_unwrap</code></a>.</li>
<li><code>debug!</code> statements <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7822">generate no
code</a> unless you pass <code>--cfg
debug</code> to <code>rustc</code>. This should help keep code size down and make your
programs a (tiny bit) faster. Now you don&rsquo;t have to feel bad about having
<code>debug!</code> in hot code.</li>
<li>The <code>mutate_values</code> method of HashMap <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7815">has been
removed</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Notable library additions, bugfixes, and cleanup</h2>

<ul>
<li>An iterator adaptor was added that <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7882">endlessly repeats the iterator it is
called on</a>.</li>
<li>Generated test runners <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7840">now have a
<code>-h</code>/<code>--help</code></a> option.</li>
<li>Metric capturing + racheting <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7829">has been
added</a> for benchmarks.</li>
<li><code>local_data</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7841">now has a
<code>get_mut</code></a> function.</li>
<li><code>extra::semver</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7726">has been updated to SemVer
2.0.0</a>.</li>
<li>Consuming iterators <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7806">have been
added</a> for the hash structures.</li>
<li><code>extra::ringbuf</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7808">now implements
DoubleEndedIterator</a>.</li>
<li><code>Eq</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7799">now has a default implementation of
<code>ne</code></a>.</li>
<li><code>extra::term</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7716">now knows how to handle more
attributes</a>.</li>
<li>More containers <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7788">implement
FromIter</a>. This means you can use
<code>.collect()</code> to gather the elements from an iterator into those containers.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7858">Task killing, failure, and exit code
propagation</a> in the new runtime
has been implemented.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Notable compiler additions, bugfixes, and cleanup</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>syntax::attr</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7902">has been
modernized</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7710">Tons of debuginfo work</a> from mw
this week!</li>
<li>Trait data structures <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7886">have been cleaned
up</a>, as well as a default method
fix.</li>
<li>Intrinsics <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7851">now have much better
codegen</a>.</li>
<li>A <code>no_implicit_prelude</code> attribute <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7844">has been
added</a>, which prevents prelude
injection in the module heirarchy starting at the item which that attribute
is added to.</li>
<li>C-style enum variants are <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7827">now
allowed</a> in <code>[T, ..n]</code>
expressions.</li>
<li>All language items are <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7828">now
optional</a>. The compiler emits an
error if a language item is used but not provided.</li>
<li>The removal of <code>spanned&lt;T&gt;</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7826">has
begun</a>.</li>
<li>Headers <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7816">have been removed</a> for
<code>~str</code> and <code>~[T]</code> where <code>T</code> is unmanaged.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Documentation, tools, and other stuff</h2>

<ul>
<li>rustpkg <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7419">now works when you don&rsquo;t give it a package
ID</a>. It builds/installs/cleans
the package in the current directory, <em>iff</em> the current directory is in a
rustpkg workspace.</li>
<li><code>--quiet</code> is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7847">no longer passed</a>
to git during submodule operations, so you can see the progress of the huge
LLVM download.</li>
<li>Documentation of the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7823">lint-controlling
attributes</a> was added.</li>
<li>rustpkg <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7681">now handles cloning from local git
repos</a>.</li>
<li>The GtkSourceView highlighting file <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7795">was
improved</a>.</li>
</ul>

of Rust and its community.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking on master?</h1>

<p>Issue churn this week was -17! A total of 63 PRs were merged this week, twice
as many as last week. Not bad!</p>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7677">task local storage (TLS)
API</a> was cleaned up (there&rsquo;s
still <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7751">one PR</a> in the queue that
finishes it up).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7652">DList was modernized</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7704"><code>extra::json</code> now uses <code>Iterator&lt;char&gt;</code> rather than a
<code>@Reader</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7117">Various free-standing functions in f32 etc were
removed</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7262">ref bindings in irrefutable patterns has been tightened
up</a>. This potentially fixes <em>and
breaks</em> code. It&rsquo;s breaking because the compiler now rejects incorrect
programs that it did not before.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7612">str no longer encodes invalid
utf-8</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7629"><code>extra::rope</code> was removed</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7594"><code>extra::net_ip</code> and so on were
removed</a>. They were redundant
names for <code>extra::net::ip</code> and such</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7570"><code>Iterator::size_hint</code>&rsquo;s lower bound is no longer an
Option</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Notable compiler additions, bugfixes, and cleanup</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7763">Unnecessary basic blocks were
removed</a>. This makes for much
easier to read unoptimized IR.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7734">Use of <code>*int</code>/<code>*uint</code> is now properly
warned</a> in FFI functions.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7725">More default method fixes</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7717">needless copy</a> was removed
from immediate values (I&rsquo;m pretty sure LLVM optimized it away when
optimizations were on, not positive).</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7706">lint for overqualified names</a>
was added.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7705">SIMD arithmetic</a> was
implemented.</li>

<h1>Meetings</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Meeting-weekly-2013-07-09">Tuesday
meeting</a> was
all about split stacks and FFI. It&rsquo;s complex and above my ability to
summarize, but from what I can tell no real consensus was made. But, it&rsquo;s the
best enumeration of all the various issues surrounding split stacks that I&rsquo;ve
seen.</p>

    <updated>2013-07-06T15:45:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://cmr.github.io/blog/2013/07/06/this-week-in-rust</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome to the fifth issue of <em>This Week in Rust</em>, a weekly overview
of Rust and its community.</p>

<p><code>0.7</code> was released this week. Hello to the newcomers! I&rsquo;ve also decided to put
breaking changes first. Feel free to skip the rest, it&rsquo;s relatively
unimportant.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Newcomers</h1>

<p>There&rsquo;s already a lot of traffic from Rust newbies, so you get your own
section! Welcome to Rust. I wrote <a href="http://cmr.github.io/blog/2013/07/05/the-state-of-rust/">The State of Rust
0.7</a> especially for
newcomers, so you should read that. Jump on IRC if you have any questions or
need help. We&rsquo;re a quite friendly bunch, and we usually don&rsquo;t bite.</p>

<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking on master?</h1>

<p>Issue churn this week was +12. 35 PRs were merged, total PR churn was -8.
There continues to be a lot more cleanup than breaking changes, which is
encouraging! As I understand it, graydon wants to focus this release cycle on
cleanup, rather than language features. Hopefully the compiler can get into a
much better state.</p>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>dbaupp <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7487">continues</a> to
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7566">slaughter</a> the free functions in
<code>std::vec</code> where methods can replace them.</li>
<li>He also <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7523">added a lint for lowercase
statics</a>, which is enabled by
default because of an astoundingly poor error message.</li>
<li>Seldaek <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7474">moved a bunch of iter
stuff</a> to <code>extra</code>.</li>
</ul>

throughout the rest of the codebase (besides compiletest, apparently).</li>
<li>acrichto <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7465">rewrote some str code</a>
to avoid allocations.</li>

<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7605">#7605</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7521">#7521</a>). They are entirely
unused, they just need to be removed and the fallout fixed throughout the
compiler.</li>

<li>sanxiyn <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7543">fixed a bug</a> where
eligible newtype structs weren&rsquo;t marked as an immediate value (and thus not

<h1>Meetings</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Meeting-weekly-2013-07-02">Tuesday meeting</a>
featured more discussion about <code>@</code> and <code>@mut</code>, that was honestly over my head
(as most of the type system stuff is). If someone wants to write some more
here, feel free to email me (<a href="&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#x63;&#111;&#x72;&#x65;&#121;&#x2b;&#x62;&#108;&#x6f;&#103;&#x40;&#x6f;&#99;&#116;&#x61;&#x79;&#110;&#x2e;&#110;&#x65;&#x74;">&#99;&#111;&#x72;&#101;&#x79;&#43;&#x62;&#x6c;&#111;&#x67;&#64;&#x6f;&#99;&#x74;&#x61;&#x79;&#x6e;&#x2e;&#x6e;&#x65;&#x74;</a>) a paragraph or two.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Given the influx of newcomers from the 0.7 release, I thought it&rsquo;d be a good
idea to summarize the condition of Rust, its libraries, and its documentation.
bstrie said it best I think, &ldquo;basically, any question of the form &lsquo;is there a
reason for this stupid and terrible thing&rsquo; is &lsquo;no, sorry, we&rsquo;re working on
it&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;.</p>

<h1>Iterators</h1>

<p>External iterators are a main feature of the 0.7 release, and there is ongoing
work to remove all of the library features that use internal iterators. Most
of them are gone, and there are few uses of internal iterators. However, they
are clunky to use. The <code>for</code> loop semantics are going to change from internal
iteration to external iteration, but they are still internal iteration right
now, which means the <code>advance</code> adaptor is necessary for most uses of
iterators. Additionally, the <code>iter()</code> helper function is necessary to actually
return an iterator. This will be obviated by an <code>Iterable</code> trait that many
things will hopefully implement. Due to
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/5898">5898</a>, many methods are oddly
named or have an underscore appended (ie, <code>transform</code> instead of <code>map</code>,
<code>position_</code> instead of <code>position</code>).</p>

<h1>IO</h1>

<p>IO has been a bit of a losing proposition since at least 0.2. The interface is
very primitive and inefficient. It requires using <code>@Trait</code> objects (<code>@Reader</code>
/ <code>@Writer</code>). It&rsquo;s also very undocumented. But the situation isn&rsquo;t going to
improve much because all of that code is getting torn out when brson/the
interns finish their work on the new runtime. On the plus side, we&rsquo;ll have
shiny new IO when they&rsquo;re done! If you want to contribute, there&rsquo;s plenty of
work to be done in this area:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/6169">issue 6169</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/6850">issue 6850</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/4419">issue 4419</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2013-May/004305.html">brson&rsquo;s status report for June</a></li>
</ul>


<h1>Compiler</h1>

<p>The compiler is still buggy and inefficient. Lots of things work, but lots of
things don&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s still some resolve bugs (the one mentioned above, as
well as some others, and perpetually poor error messages), default methods
don&rsquo;t work, debuginfo is incomplete, the compiler has quadratic codegen when
using <code>match</code>, so on and so forth. There&rsquo;s a lot of work to be done here but
it&rsquo;s not easy. I&rsquo;m writing a series about the compiler that should help new
contributors get started and grok how it all fits together. The only thing
making Rust usable right now is LLVM&rsquo;s fantastic optimization. Our no-opt
builds run slower than our opt builds under Valgrind. Ponder that for a
minute.</p>

<h1><code>rustpkg</code></h1>

<p>rustpkg is still heavily in-progress and unfinished. It&rsquo;s usable, but not
everything is implemented, and the documentation is incomplete. It&rsquo;s rather
unintuitive to use right now, but it does work! Read the
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/doc/rustpkg.md">manual</a> carefully
if you want to use it.</p>

<h1>Documentation</h1>

<p>Documentation is poor. <code>rustdoc</code> is really bad, which doesn&rsquo;t help. I&rsquo;m
working on a new rustdoc (<a href="http://rustlog.octayn.net">I log my progress
here</a>), but it won&rsquo;t be ready for some weeks. Lots
of things are undocumented or near impossible to find because of how bad
<code>rustdoc</code> is. The tutorials need lots of work, and a guided tour of the
libraries would be nice, as well as a &ldquo;Rust By Example,&rdquo; showing how to
accomplish common goals. These aren&rsquo;t really hard to do, it&rsquo;s just that nobody
has done them yet.</p>

<h1>Libraries</h1>

<p>There are few robust libraries or bindings to libraries, for anything, besides
what is in std/extra. There&rsquo;s the stuff servo uses (glfw, skia, sdl), and an
opengl binding somewhere, but beyond that, you&rsquo;re on your own. The
<a href="https://github.com/crabtw/rust-bindgen">rust-bindgen</a> tool can help with
wrapping a C library. There is no GUI library available yet, no real
networking. It&rsquo;s easy to wrap a C library, you just need to be careful with
your <code>unsafe</code> blocks. Once again, these things aren&rsquo;t hard, they just haven&rsquo;t
been done yet.</p>

<h1>The future</h1>

<p>Basically everything is heavily WIP, but it&rsquo;s constantly improving. We always
need more contributors, ask in IRC if you&rsquo;re interested. Rust 0.7 is pre-alpha
quality, IMO. It would be silly to use Rust for something important, but don&rsquo;t
let that stop you from trying to do something ambitious. If you feel Rust is
still too young to get involved, but you want to track its progress, I write
<a href="http://cmr.github.io/blog/categories/this-week-in-rust/">This Week in Rust</a>,
which is an easy way to track our progress. 1.0 is tentatively planned for
first-quarter 2014, last I heard, and I don&rsquo;t think that is out of reach. 1.0
corresponds to &ldquo;maturity #2&rdquo; at the absolute minimum (the maturiy levels are
listed <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/milestones">as milestones</a>).</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t be discouraged. It was far worse before! Rust is in a good position,
it&rsquo;s just not quite all there yet. This post may seem pessimistic, but the
progress Rust has made is astonishing. Here&rsquo;s to a wonderful 0.8!</p>

    <link href="http://cmr.github.io/blog/2013/06/30/structure-and-organisation-of-rustc/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-30T16:03:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://cmr.github.io/blog/2013/06/30/structure-and-organisation-of-rustc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This is the second part of a planned series about <code>rustc</code>, the Rust compiler</em></p>

<p>This post is going to discuss the structure and organisation of <code>rustc</code>,
covering the major moving parts and how they interact. I&rsquo;ll start, of course,
where it starts, and ending, of course, where it ends.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><code>rustc</code> is a fairly large, complex beast. Unless otherwise mentioned, all
paths are relative to <code>src/librustc</code>. If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with Rust, a
&ldquo;crate&rdquo; is a compilation unit: a library or an executable.</p>

<h2>Beginning</h2>

<p>The entry point, <code>run_compiler</code> in <code>rustc.rs</code>, does argument parsing, using
<code>extra::getopts</code> and calls into the driver, in <code>driver/driver.rs</code>, which
coordinates the various pieces of the compiler and the rest of the argument
parsing. The key data structure here is the <code>Session</code>, which you can find
(along with a bunch of other things like the option context) in
<code>driver/session.rs</code>. Back to the driver, the function <code>compile_input</code> is where
most of the magic happens. This function runs all the various passes over the
crate. It starts with parsing and macro expansion and moves onto various
static analysis of the code to make sure it is correct, finally generating
LLVM IR (intermediate representation), running LLVM optimizations, and linking
the final binary.</p>

<h2>An interlude</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with compilers, you might find this process a
labyrinthine fractal of complexity. Which it is, don&rsquo;t get me wrong. But the
various pieces of the rust compiler are fairly well separated, even if they
are complex. The basic structure of a compiler is operations on a tree data
structure representing the crate called an AST or Abstract Syntax Tree. An AST
is the output of parsing, and everything in the compiler is transforms or
analysis of this tree. Once everything is done, it takes this AST and
translates it into LLVM IR. This is probably the most hairy part of the
compiler, and it lives in <code>middle/trans</code>. LLVM IR is a representation of code
that the LLVM library can operate on to optimize and generate native machine
code. LLVM does most of the heavy lifting that a traditional compiler would
need to do (optimization and codegen), so the rest of <code>rustc</code> is largely
dedicated to actually dealing with Rust programs.</p>

<h2>Parsing + expansion</h2>

<p>Parsing and macro expansion happen in <code>src/libsyntax</code>, so all paths in this
section will be relative to that. This corresponds to <code>phase_1_parse_input</code>
and <code>phase_2_configure_and_expand</code>. Phase 1 does the parsing, and results in
an AST. If you want, you can look into <code>parse/parser.rs</code> for the
<code>parse_crate_mod</code> method. Very rarely will one have to modify the parser. The
most important part of the parser, from an outsider&rsquo;s perspective, is in
<code>codemap.rs</code>. The codemap has the concept of a &ldquo;span&rdquo;, which is a piece of
source code, represented by a start and an end. Whenever you see an error and
a squiggly line underneath where the error happenes, that is the result of a
span. Almost everything in the AST has a span.</p>

<p>After phase 1 comes, of course, phase 2. Phase 2 is what does macro expansion,
deriving implementations, and removal of items which are conditionally
included with the <code>cfg</code> attribute. This all happens in the <code>ext</code> directory.
Personally I haven&rsquo;t poked around too much at how macros work, but things to
note are <code>cfg.rs</code>, <code>asm.rs</code>, <code>ifmt.rs</code>, and the <code>deriving</code> directory. These do
<code>cfg!</code>, <code>asm!</code>, <code>format!</code> (and friends), and <code>#[deriving(...)]</code>,
respectively.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re curious how a syntax extension works, <code>env.rs</code> is a good example. In
the <code>expand_env</code> function, it takes the syntax extension context (cx), a
span of the macro invocation, and the &ldquo;token tree&rdquo; that the macro was invoked
with.  When you do <code>foo!(....)</code>, the <code>....</code> is the token tree. It checks the
structure of the token tree (it expects either one or two arguments), and then
returns the environment variable referenced by constructing an <code>ast::Expr</code>,
using the ExtCtxt to mark that the expression came from the given span. This
is so the compiler can track which span a piece of macro-generated code
initially came from, for better error reporting.</p>

<p>You might notice that phase 2 actually runs the configuration step twice. This
is so that macros that expand to items with a <code>cfg</code> attribute also get removed
from the final output.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>Phase 3, the analysis phases, is the real meat of rustc. All of this code
lives in <code>middle</code>. The most important passes are probably typeck, the type
checker; resolve, the name resolver; borrowck, the borrow checker; and lint,
the lint runner. Not to say the other passes aren&rsquo;t important, but they&rsquo;re
less frequently worked or worried about by mere mortals such as myself.</p>

<h2>Trans(lation)</h2>

<p>trans is the part of the compiler that takes the AST from syntax as
well as the tables created by analysis and outputs LLVM IR. All of this
happens in <code>middle/trans</code>. There is a lot of code, and I&rsquo;ve never actually
been able to figure out which piece generates what.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s my basic overview of how the compiler is structured. If you want
something added, or as questions get asked, I&rsquo;ll fill in more information. The
analysis and trans sections are sparse as I&rsquo;ve little experience with them.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome to the fourth issue of <em>This Week in Rust</em>, a weekly overview of Rust and its community.</p>

<p><code>0.7</code> is being cut soon (today, I think). There are preliminary release notes <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.txt">on
GitHub</a>. The tree has been quite calm, with regards to
breakage. Cycle time is still high, but at least when things land they don&rsquo;t break master.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking on master?</h1>

<p>Issue churn this week was -1. Yay! Issue churn this month was -47. 61 people pushed 1,080 commits, changing 2,117 files
and adding a total of 53347 lines.  The top 10 committers were pcwalton, brson, dbaupp, strcat, bblum, nmatsakis,
acricto, Blei, me (cmr), and aatch.</p>

<p>Much of the work this week was cleanup or rebases of older PRs that just hadn&rsquo;t made it in yet.</p>

<h2>Notable additions, bugfixes, and cleanup</h2>

<ul>
<li>Eridius has finished (I think!) the last bit of UNIX <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7436">terminal support</a>,
adding fallback and smarter detection. It should work in 8-color terminals now too.</li>
<li>pcwalton <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7451">rewrote each_path</a>, with the goal of future performance
enhancements.</li>
<li>tjc has done a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7397">bunch</a> of
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7403">rustpkg</a> work.</li>
<li>aatch did some <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7272">trans cleanup</a>.</li>
<li>gifnksm added <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7414"><code>max_by</code> and <code>min_by</code></a> methods to <code>IteratorUtil</code> for getting
the largest/smallest value in an iterator given a score function.</li>
<li>brson got a fix that <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7111">releases large stacks</a> after they are used to lower
memory usage.</li>
<li>mw has a bunch of <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7432">debuginfo</a> work, as well as <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7255">docs and
cleanup</a>.</li>
<li>Blei did an <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7254">intrinsic overhaul</a>.</li>
<li>acrichto implemented <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7291"><code>static mut</code></a>, for globals. Using them requires
unsafe code.</li>
<li>DaGenix <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7207">cleaned up and extended</a> the SHA code.</li>
<li>acrichto renamed <code>.rc</code> files to <code>.rs</code>. <code>.rc</code> is deprecated and functionally equivalent to <code>.rs</code>, all new code should
use it. He also <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7371">added</a> a <code>warnings</code> lint attribute for enabling/disabling
warnings in bulk.</li>
<li>indutny added <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7257"><code>mman</code> (including <code>mmap</code>)</a> FFI.</li>
<li>dbaupp found a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7297">curious performance win</a> by changing some ordering around,
while also enabling conditionally defined macros and macro expansion to items with <code>#[cfg]</code> attributes.</li>
<li>Luqman <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7410">fixed by-value self</a>.</li>
<li>acrichto expanded the <code>deriving(ToStr)</code> code to use <code>ToStr</code> on fields rather than using <code>fmt!("%?", x)</code>.</li>
<li>Blei <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7214">fixed a lot of problems</a> with owned trait objects (<code>~Trait</code>).</li>
<li>sully has <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7471">landed some default method fixes</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>As usual, <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7274">a</a> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7334">bunch</a>
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7373">of</a> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7319">iterator</a> work.</li>
<li>pcwalton renamed Owned to Send and Const to Freeze, better reflecting their actual semantics.</li>
<li>He also disallowed <code>mut</code> from distributing over bindings. For example, the following code no longer works: <code>let mut
(a, b) = (c, d)</code>.</li>
<li>dbaupp <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7430">converted</a> many vector functions to methods. He has a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7487">second
part</a> in line.</li>
<li>Luqman renamed the <code>finalize</code> method in the <code>Drop</code> trait to <code>drop</code>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Other changes</h2>

<p>bblum did some trait/fn/closure bounds
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7314">here</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7354">here</a>, but I don&rsquo;t really
understand what they do or their significance. He said:</p>

<blockquote><p>it changes the way traits/closures and captured data fulfill kind bounds, so<br/>you can restrict or loosen the requirements instead of having the fixed<br/>defaults of &#8220;can only capture Send things in ~fn/~Trait&#8221;</p><p>one example is that you can add the extra requirement of Freeze, so you can<br/>put existential data inside of ARCs</p><p>see https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/test/run-pass/trait-bounds-in-arc.rs</p><p>http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2013/06/11/data-parallelism-in-rust/<br/>is another, more complicated but less contrived, example for how they would be<br/>useful</p></blockquote>


<h1>Meetings</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Meeting-weekly-2013-06-25">Tuesday meeting</a>
mainly discussed <code>@mut</code> and iterators, as well as some minor 0.7 releng stuff.
I suggest reading the <code>@mut</code> discussion yourself, but essentially it revolves
around it not quite fitting into the language, and that it could be easily
punted to a library. The iterator discussion was not notable.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This is the first part of a planned series about <code>rustc</code>, the Rust compiler</em></p>

<p>I remember first hearing about Rust during the summer of 2011. In fact, I
remember the exact moment. I was at MIT, doing their Junction program. It was
during a seminar about semiconductors. I remember browsing through the source on github,
getting lost, and going home.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Fast forward to two months ago. A <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/13/04/03/1646234/mozilla-and-samsung-collaborating-to-bring-new-browser-engine-to-android">slashdot post</a> appears, bringing Rust
back to the forefront of my consciousness. By this point I&rsquo;d actually gained
some programming chops, gotten a job, etc. I read through the Wikipedia
article, though &ldquo;hey, this looks like it has potential,&rdquo; and forgot about it.</p>

<p>Fast forward a week or two. The <a href="http://www.matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges/">matasano crypto challenges</a> were linked
on HN. &ldquo;Our friend Maciej says these challenges are a good way to learn a new
language, so maybe now&rsquo;s the time to pick up Clojure or Rust.&rdquo; And pick up
Rust I did. Rust was a pretty easy language to get started with, with my
predominantly Python, C, and Lua background. Especially for the crypto
challenges, which start off fairly basic.</p>

<h1>First, some warnings:</h1>

<p>Rust is pre-alpha software. Backwards incompatible changes happen <em>weekly</em>,
either in the libraries, or in the language.  It&rsquo;s probably best to not write
any &ldquo;serious&rdquo; code in Rust right now, unless you plan on fixing it every few
weeks to keep up with the language. The nice part about contributing code to
the compiler is that when someone changes the language or a library, it is
their job to fix the code that uses it.</p>

<p>Make sure to use the <code>master</code> branch, and <strong>use the doc links under &ldquo;Trunk&rdquo;.
It will save you pain.</strong> Nothing is worse than accidentally using the 0.6
documentation and finding that a method has been renamed or removed, and
getting confused when the build fails halfway through.</p>

<p><strong>The Rust compiler is poorly written.</strong> This is an artifact of being written
in Rust, which, as stated, changes rapidly. Some code is very old, and uses
very old idioms, or doesn&rsquo;t use newer language features that would be cleaner
and easier to read. If you notice this, try and fix it! If you notice it, that
means you already more-or-less know what needs to be done to clean it up a
bit. If the change is very invasive, it&rsquo;s probably best to open an issue and
let an experienced dev deal with it. An example of a cleanup is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7315">pull request
7315</a>, which cleaned up indentation
and replaced some <code>if</code>s with <code>match</code>es.</p>

<p>Do not, repeat, <em>not</em>, use the <code>rustc</code> code as a source of &ldquo;how to write
Rust.&rdquo; Almost all of it is bad code. I don&rsquo;t even know where to tell you to
look to find consistently good code.  The upside is that generally reviewers
will catch suboptimal code, and suggest improvements.  <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7207">This pull request, for
example</a>, used some old Rust
idioms, which the reviewers suggested fixes for. So feel free to get
elbow-deep in code without worrying <em>too</em> much about whether the code you&rsquo;re
writing is good or bad. General guidelines: avoid <code>@</code> always, avoid <code>~</code>
usually, use <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code>, handle errors. That will guide you
straight most of the time, and by the time you know when to ignore those, you
probably already know what good Rust code is.</p>

<h1>Getting started</h1>

<p>The first thing I did was, of course, go to the <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">home page</a>. I read the
feature summary (which seemed mostly unchanged from when I first saw it.
Indeed, looking in the wayback machine, it is mostly unchanged). I read the
example, and clicked <a href="http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial.html">&ldquo;tutorial&rdquo;</a> over on the left. I built the compiler
while doing this. There are instructions for building Rust over at <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Note-getting-started-developing-Rust">the wiki</a>.
It&rsquo;s a lot easier to get started if you&rsquo;re using Linux or Mac, though not
impossible on Windows (just a bit more setup and waiting).</p>

<p>The tutorial left me confused and alone, and I&rsquo;m sure it did the same to
you. But it gave me enough information that I could write a base64 encode and
decoder, although I constantly referenced the tutorial. By this point I had
moved on to the second matasano challenge, and I found my first compiler bug:
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/6072">really poor error messages</a>. Of course I had to fix this! Error
messages are easy, right?</p>

<p>Yes and no. With a codebase as large and complex as a compiler, there are many
layers of stuff you need to pick apart to figure out the cause and fix of an
issue. In my case, it was easy, just grep for the error message. The fix,
however, was more complex. I had to figure out how to turn a &ldquo;span&rdquo; (the
compiler&rsquo;s way of matching up an AST node with a chunk of source code) in a
string. Often you&rsquo;ll need to go digging through other files to figure out what
you can do, what data structures there are, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Rust makes this easy!</strong> There are no IDEs or any fancy tools, but Rust
source is insanely <code>grep</code>able. You see a method call like
<code>parser.parse_ident(...)</code>, you just need to grep for <code>fn parse_ident</code>.
Of course, actually understanding what the method does is a whole new can of
worms&hellip;</p>

<h1>Picking an issue to fix</h1>

<p>I think the best way to pick an issue to fix is to fix a bug you encounter
yourself. Ask in IRC about it, often someone will be online that either knows
about it and can point you in the right direction, or at the very least help
reproduce, debug, and sift through the issue trcker.</p>

<p>There is the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues?labels=E-easy"><code>E-easy</code></a>
label on certain issues. This are issues that shouldn&rsquo;t take too much trickery
to get done, though they might take some time to get &ldquo;acclimated&rdquo; to the
codebase. <code>E-easy</code> doesn&rsquo;t mean fast, it means easy. It might be tedius or
take non-trivial amounts of effort, but it shouldn&rsquo;t require overarching
design issues or a lot of knowledge about rust or rust internals.</p>

<p>Documentation always needs writing. Open a random file from libstd or
libextra, look for functions, structs, enums, and traits that aren&rsquo;t
documented. You&rsquo;ll get to see a bunch of Rust code, probably using features
you wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise see writing &ldquo;normal&rdquo; code.</p>

<h1>After you fix it</h1>

<p>Once you fix the issue, open a pull request. See <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">GitHub&rsquo;s
help</a> for how to do
this. If you get stuck or need additional help, jump onto IRC
(<a href="http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&amp;channel=%23rust">webchat</a>)
and ask. Someone will have to review your changes, ask &ldquo;r?
$link_to_pull_request&rdquo; in IRC to expedite the process.</p>

<p>Feel free to ping me (cmr) on IRC if you have any questions or problem.</p>
