    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome to another issue of <em>This Week in Rust</em>. We&rsquo;re gearing up
for the 0.8 release in 2-3 weeks. It looks like it&rsquo;s going to be a really
solid release. I&rsquo;ll write another <code>State of Rust</code>, hopefully before it is
released.</p>

<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking in master?</h1>

<p>68 PRs were merged this week.</p>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>std::iterator</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9065">has been
renamed</a> to <code>std::iter</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>std::num::Primitive</code> trait is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9051">now
constrained</a> by the <code>Clone</code> and
<code>DeepClone</code> traits, as well as
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9182"><code>Orderable</code></a>.</li>
<li>Some <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9062">more free functions</a> have
been removed from <code>std::vec</code>. <code>unzip</code> now takes an iterator, a
<code>Permutations</code> iterator has been added, and some rarely-used, obsolete,
functions were removed.</li>
<li>A bunch of changes to <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9115">were
made</a>. Specifically, <code>chain</code> was
changed to <code>and_then</code> and <code>unwrap_or_default</code> to <code>unwrap_or</code>.</li>
<li>rustpkg <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9151">builds into
target-specific</a> subdirectories
now.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Additions and fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>debuginfo now has <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9097">namespace
support</a>. Looking at all the
various PRs Michael has opened over the summer, it seems DWARF is a very
flexible, nice debuginfo format, but gdb and LLVM don&rsquo;t support it very
well.</li>
<li>Correct <code>range_step</code> and <code>range_step_inclusive</code> iterators <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9199">have been
added</a>. They are correct in cases
of overflow, and are generic.</li>
<li>A handy <code>sleep</code> function <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9191">has been
added</a> to newrt.</li>
<li>File IO in newrt <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9165">works on
windows</a> now.</li>
<li>A bug where nested items in a default method weren&rsquo;t compiled <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9162">has been
fixed</a>.</li>
<li>A rendezvous concurrency structure, much like Ada&rsquo;s, <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8908">has been
added</a>.</li>
<li>Buffered IO wrappers <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9091">have been
added</a>.</li>
<li>nmatsakis landed a PR that <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9088">closed 7 issues at
once</a>.</li>
<li>rustpkg now uses <code>extra::workcache</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9034">to prevent recompilation of
already-compiled crates</a>.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to another <em>This Week in Rust</em>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking in master?</h1>

<p>65 pull requests were merged this week, and bors has had some idle time when
there wasn&rsquo;t anything approved in the queue.</p>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>std::os::glob</code> has been replaced with a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8914">pure Rust
version</a>, for cross-platform and
compatability reasons.</li>
<li><code>std::str::from_bytes</code> has been
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8997">renamed</a> to
<code>std::str::from_utf8</code>, to be explicit about what it accepts.</li>
<li>Casting to bool with <code>as</code> is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8980">no longer
allowed</a>, and surrogate
characters are no longer allowed in strings.</li>
<li>char is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8974">no longer</a> treated as an
integer type (meaning it can&rsquo;t be casted to/from them), which removes the
ability for safe code to create invalid characters.</li>
<li>Opening a listening socket and actually listening on it <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8954">have been
split</a>. If you&rsquo;re jiggy with the
jive, listen and accept are now separate operations. (<em>ed</em>: this used to say
bind and accept wereseparate; thanks to ecr for the correction.)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Additions</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>let</code> var hygiene has <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9026">landed</a>.
I&rsquo;m sure this has cool implications, but I don&rsquo;t really know what they are.</li>
<li>An <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8903"><code>export_name</code> attribute</a> has
been added to control what symbol name something is exported as (similar to
<code>no_mangle</code>).</li>
<li>An <code>ExactSize</code> trait <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8884">has been
added</a> to mark an iterator that
always accurately reports its size in the <code>size_hint</code> method.</li>
<li><code>ToStr</code> has been <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8960">implemented</a>
for char and Ascii.</li>
<li>Safe accessors of <code>MutexArc</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8966">have been
implemented</a></li>
<li>A bytes iterator <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8935">has been added</a>
for newrt readers.</li>
<li>Stream is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8984">automatically
implemented</a> for types which
implement Reader and Writer from newrt.</li>
<li>An <code>unreachable</code> macro <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8992">has been
added</a> for better error reporting
than a function could do.</li>
<li>newrt <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9000">can now do</a> simple DNS
resolution.</li>
<li>strptime/strftime <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9016">now support</a>
fractional seconds, out to tenths of a nanosecond.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Changes etc</h2>

<ul>
<li>Name mangling <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8875">has been
improved</a>.</li>
<li><code>rust_log.cpp</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8880">has been
converted</a> into pure Rust.</li>
<li>Debuginfo <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8855">now does closure
capture</a> and very large structs.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8947">bunch</a>
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8927">of</a>
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8928">repr</a> improvements landed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Congratulations to them all. The interns did a ton of great work over the
summer.</p>

<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking on master?</h1>

<p>There were only 46 PRs merged this week. I don&rsquo;t quite know why that number is
so low this week. It certainly wasn&rsquo;t for lack of PRs: the queue has been
constantly backlogged. Issue churn was -26, yay!</p>

<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8526">Some functions in Result and Either were replaced to work with external
iterators</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8423">The <code>priv</code> and <code>pub</code> visibility modifiers are now forbidden on contexts
where they have no meaning</a>. For
example, marking a struct field <code>pub</code>, or a module <code>priv</code>. The compiler
errors for this are quite informative, and the conversion is purely
mechanical.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8532"><code>to_c_str</code> now raises a condition if the string contains interior <code>NUL</code>s,
as it is impossible to create a valid C string with interior
<code>NUL</code>s</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Library improvments, bugfixes, and cleanup</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8446"><code>ifmt!</code>, the new formatter, has been
finished</a>. Yay!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8453"><code>extra::stats::write_boxplot</code> now works with negative or zero sample
values</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8452">Some missing pieces in libstd have been filled
in</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8491">A <code>sample</code> method has been added to <code>RngUtil</code>, for resevior
sampling</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Compiler improvements, bugfixes, and cleanup</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8527">A ton of work was done on a new
visitor</a>. This is the first of a
series of five.</li>

methods</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8497">Trait object coercion to <code>&amp;Trait</code> has been fixed to handle freezing and
reborrowing more correctly</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8329">Debuginfo of lexical scopes and variable shadowing has been massively
improved</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8410">A <code>--target-cpu</code> flag has been added to select the target CPU, rather than
always using &ldquo;generic&rdquo;</a>.</li>

    <link href="http://cmr.github.io/blog/2013/08/13/rust-by-concept/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-13T01:14:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://cmr.github.io/blog/2013/08/13/rust-by-concept</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Note:</strong> I accidentally published this. I won&rsquo;t take it down, but it is
incomplete and I do not guarantee its correctness.</p>

<p>Rust seems to intimidate newcomers, as its memory model is fairly complex. I
think part of the problem is that the language tutorial introduces the memory
model by feature.  Rather, I&rsquo;ll introduce it by concept, showing examples of
code that breaks memory safety in C, and how Rust&rsquo;s memory model prevents the
error. Hopefully I can convince you that Rust isn&rsquo;t as complex as it looks,
and that the extra syntax is well-worth the zero-cost memory safety. I&rsquo;ll be
comparing Rust code to equivalent C idioms using the <a href="http://zeromq.org/"><code>zeromq
library</code></a> because it has a very clean API in both
languages. As such, I assume basic familiarity with C. Rust is not a very
suitable language for new programmers, and neither is this tutorial.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The core concepts driving Rust&rsquo;s memory management are, in reverse order of
simplicity, <em>ownership</em>, <em>mutability</em>, and <em>lifetime</em>. It&rsquo;s not that other
languages don&rsquo;t have them, it&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re implicit or convention. I
won&rsquo;t be using many fancy features of Rust here. They aren&rsquo;t needed to explain
the memory management, variables and functions suffice.</p>

<h1>Ownership</h1>

<p>Ownership is simply who is responsibile for freeing an object. If you own an
object, you are ensured it is valid.</p>

<p>An example in C would be:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>void *context = zmq_ctx_new(); // zeromq owns the context, you just get to use it
</span><span class='line'>// ...
</span><span class='line'>zmq_ctx_destroy(context); // you need to tell zeromq to free it, you aren't allowed to do so</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In Rust:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>let context: ~Context = zmq_ctx_new();
</span><span class='line'>// ....
</span><span class='line'>// context implicitly freed when no one owns it anymore</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Notice that the C uses an opaque <code>void*</code> and that Rust uses
the explicitly-named <code>~Context</code>. In C, you often use opaque types because the
language offers no control over visibility of struct members. In Rust, you can
mark the fields of a struct <code>priv</code>, which will disallow users of the library
from using those fields. This is a bit nuanced, and I&rsquo;ll explain it in a later
tutorial on privacy and the module system.</p>

<p>The tilde means &ldquo;owned pointer&rdquo;, in that if you have an owned pointer to an
object, you are the owner. Creating an owned pointer involves a heap
allocation (malloc). I use an owned pointer in these examples to mirror the C,
but idiomatic Rust uses values on the stack much more frequently than values
on the heap.</p>

<h2>Taking ownership</h2>

<p>Rust goes one step further with ownership. The compiler asserts that an object
cannot be owned multiple times. An object can be owned by a stack frame
(locals and function arguments), a scope, or a struct. For lack of a better
term, I&rsquo;ll call these &ldquo;owners.&rdquo; You transfer ownership by &ldquo;moving&rdquo; into an
owner. Once an owner loses ownership, the compiler will error if you try to
use the object again through that owner.  This disallows dangling pointers and
prevents an entire class of error (and potentially vulnerability), &ldquo;use after
free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In C, it&rsquo;s perfectly valid to do:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>void *context = zmq_ctx_new();
</span><span class='line'>zmq_ctx_destroy(context);
</span><span class='line'>use_context(context); // compiles fine, but clearly incorrect</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Whereas in Rust:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>let context: ~Context = zmq_ctx_new();
</span><span class='line'>{ // introduce a scope
</span><span class='line'>  let context2: ~Context = context; // context moved into the variable in this scope
</span><span class='line'>} // context2 freed at scope close
</span><span class='line'>use_context(context); // error: use of moved value: `context`</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Not taking ownership</h2>

<p>Most functions that take arguments don&rsquo;t need to take ownership. To express
this, Rust has the &ldquo;borrowed pointer.&rdquo; For example, in C you would write this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>int length(some_large_struct_t *datum) {
</span><span class='line'>  return datum-&gt;x - datum-&gt;padding;
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The function does not care who owns the object, it doesn&rsquo;t need to free it, as
there&rsquo;s no reason the object can&rsquo;t be used again after this computation. In
Rust, it&rsquo;s:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>fn length(datum: &some_large_struct) -&gt; int {
</span><span class='line'>  datum.x - datum.padding
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The first thing you&rsquo;ll notice is that there is no dereference to be found in
the source. In C, <code>-&gt;</code> is the dereferencing struct member extraction operator.
In Rust, <code>.</code> will dereference if it needs to. You&rsquo;ll also notice that Rust
uses <code>&amp;</code> rather than <code>*</code> to indicate this type of a pointer. It&rsquo;s the same
operator used to take a pointer (address-of), as in C. C, however, doesn&rsquo;t
enforce the non-transfer of ownership. It&rsquo;s perfectly valid to do:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>int length(some_large_struct_t *datum) {
</span><span class='line'>  int l = datum-&gt;x - datum-&gt;padding;
</span><span class='line'>  free(datum);
</span><span class='line'>  return l;
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><code>length</code> has now incorrectly taken ownership of <code>datum</code>, by <code>free</code>ing it. Any
code which had a pointer to <code>datum</code> has now been rendered incorrect. In Rust,
there is no way to safely free memory. It is automatically free&rsquo;d.</p>

<h2>Multiple ownership</h2>

<p>There are situations when ownership isn&rsquo;t so black and white, and for that
Rust has the &ldquo;managed pointer.&rdquo; The type of a managed pointer is <code>@'static T</code>.
The <code>'static</code> means &ldquo;this type cannot contain any borrowed pointers.&rdquo; The
shorthand for <code>@'static T</code> is just <code>@T</code>: it&rsquo;s impossible to have a managed
pointer to a type that doesn&rsquo;t fulfill <code>'static</code>. Using only owned and
borrowed pointers, ownership forms a DAG. Managed pointers allow cycles. They
are GC-managed, and allow multiple pointers to the same object. The way this
is enabled is that the pointer&rsquo;s contents (the pointee) are immutable. If
they were allowed to be mutable, data races would occur. In the next section
I&rsquo;ll show the mutable version.</p>

<p>These have no direct comparison in C. The closest comparison is probably
GOBject&rsquo;s memory management API. Managed pointers aren&rsquo;t explicit memory
management. As the name suggests, the runtime manages it for you. Managed
pointers are usually considered as a &ldquo;last resort&rdquo;. Even though GC in Rust can
be fast because all managed pointers are task-local, no GC is always faster
than some GC.</p>

<h1>Mutability</h1>

<p>Mutability is whether you are allowed to mutate, or modify, some data. There
are two pieces to mutability: mutability of things an object owns (inherited
mutability), and mutability of data through a pointer.</p>

<h2>Inherited Mutability</h2>

<p>Say you have a point on the stack:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>struct Point {
</span><span class='line'>  x: int,
</span><span class='line'>  y: int
</span><span class='line'>}
</span><span class='line'>let value: Point = Point { x: 24, y: 42 };</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you try to mutate the point by, say, changing the <code>x</code> field, the compiler
will complain:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>value.x = 42; //~ ERROR: cannot assign to immutable field</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The error message is actualy a bit misleading: there is no such thing as a
mutable field! &ldquo;Point&rdquo; is said to have inherited</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome to the tenth issue of <em>This Week in Rust</em>. This week marks
the enabling of the new runtime written entirely in Rust. A lot happens every
week, so I&rsquo;m going to start omitting PRs that I deem of lesser importance.
This process is entirely arbitrary, don&rsquo;t feel hurt if I exclude your PR :).</p>

<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking on <code>master</code>?</h1>

<p>Issue churn was -12 this week. A total of 70 PRs were merged.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8358">The new runtime has been enabled by
default</a>. This is the culmination
of a lot of work by brson and the rt interns (toddaaro, bblum, and ecr being
the ones I know of). It&rsquo;s written entirely in Rust, and lives in <code>std::rt</code>.
Additionally, the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8387">old C++ runtime has been
removed</a>.</p>

<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8296"><strong>Trailing nulls have been removed from all string
types.</strong></a>. This will break your
FFI code in subtle and mysterious ways, if you didn&rsquo;t explicitly use the
<code>as_c_str</code> methods. FFI code using the new <code>str::c_str</code> code will be more
robust, as it forbids interior nulls, and ensures that a trailing null
always exists. The replacement for <code>str.as_c_str</code> is
<code>str.to_c_str().as_slice()</code>, from what I can tell.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cmr/rust/commit/e99eff172a11816f335153147dd0800fc4877bee">The <code>priv</code> keyword is no longer allowed where it has no
meaning</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8265"><code>iter</code> and <code>iter_err</code> in Result have been replaced with external
iterators</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8288">The <code>get</code> method of <code>Option</code>, <code>Either</code>, and <code>Result</code> has been removed in
favor of <code>unwrap</code></a>. They both did
the same thing, which was useless duplication.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8218"><code>std::gc</code> and <code>std::stackwalk</code></a>
have been removed, as they are obsolete with the new runtime.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8264">The transitionary <code>foreach</code> has been
removed</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Notable library additions, bugfixes, and cleanup</h2>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome to the ninth issue of <em>This Week in Rust</em>. This week brings
the new <code>for</code> loop, which is very exciting, as well as a bunch of runtime
changes and cleanup.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking on <code>master</code>?</h1>

<p>Issue churn was +4 this week. A total of 63 PRs were merged (again).</p>

<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>The <code>for</code> loop now uses external iterators.</strong> This means any code written
to use the old internal iterator protocol will no longer work. See the
<a href="http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial-container.html">iterator tutorial</a>
for more information on how to use it. Related pull requests:
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8141">#8141</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8184">#8184</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8190">#8190</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8244">#8244</a>. A few uses now
require <code>do</code> rather than <code>for</code> because they cannot/have not been
implemented in terms of external iterators.</li>
<li><code>unsafe</code> is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8235">no longer allowed</a>
for functions in <code>extern</code> blocks: they are all unsafe.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8175"><code>extra::dbg</code> module</a> has
been removed.</li>
<li><code>uint::range</code> and all its friends have been replaced with an <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8216">external
iterator</a>, that is in the
prelude. Code like the following now works:
<code>
for x in range(0, 10) {
    println(x.to_str());
}
</code></li>
<li>The pipes compiler (the thing driving <code>proto!</code>) <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8170">has been
removed</a>, as it saw limited
use, was very old, and was a significant maintenance burden.</li>
<li><code>PortSet</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8164">has been removed</a> from
std, as the new scheduler does not support it.</li>
<li>A bunch of old task APIs <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8139">have been
removed</a>, aslo in preparation for
the new schduler.</li>
<li><code>is_utf8</code> now <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8133">rejects overlong
encodings</a>.</li>
<li>The iterator adaptors <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8090">no longer have the Iterator
suffix</a>, same with <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8095">str and vec
iterators</a> as well.</li>
</ul>


<h2>newrt changes</h2>

<p>A bunch of newrt things landed this week, so it gets its own section.</p>

<ul>
<li>Some <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8234">bugs preventing the arc and sync tests from
passing</a> have been fixed.</li>
<li>The new scheduler now supports <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8221">the <code>SingleThreaded</code> spawn
mode</a>.</li>
<li>A bunch of work with task killing <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8195">has
landed</a>.</li>
<li>Some <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8116">major TLS changes</a> also
landed.</li>
<li>Tasks can <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8158">now be named</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8008"><code>select</code> on newrt pipes</a> has
been implemented.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Notable library additions, bugfixes, and cleanup</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>Map::contains_key</code> is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8246">now a default
method</a> implemented in terms of
<code>Map::find</code></li>
<li>A <code>dynamic_lib</code> segfault <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8219">has been
fixed</a>.</li>
<li>A keyed <code>HashMap</code> constructor is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8186">now
exposed</a> for runtimeless programs
that want to use it.</li>
<li>The <code>Str</code> trait now has an <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8204"><code>into_owned</code>
method</a> to avoid copies when you
already have a <code>~str</code>.</li>
<li>A bunch of <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8174">SHA1 and SHA2
cleanup/optimizations</a> landed. I
hear that the speed is almost optimal, only a few cycles/byte short of
Intel&rsquo;s optimized implementation.</li>
<li>Errno coverage has been <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8193">significantly expanded for
Linux</a>. I added all of the ones
that were missing, at least the ones that were present on my system.</li>
<li><code>assert!()</code> without a message <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8150">now does less
allocation</a>.</li>
<li>&lsquo;\&rsquo; is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8138">no longer treated as a path
separater</a> on POSIX system.</li>
<li><code>getopt</code>&rsquo;s <code>opts_str</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8135">has been corrected to use more than just the first
element of the vector</a>.</li>
<li>Some more methods <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8115">were added</a> in
<code>std::num</code>.</li>
<li>An iterator over the offsets of each character in a string <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8082">was
added</a>.</li>
<li>A bunch of <code>RandomAccessIterator</code> implementations <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8120">have been
added</a>.</li>
<li><code>Clone</code> and <code>DeepClone</code> are <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8109">now
implemented</a> for <code>extern "Rust"
fn</code>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Notable compiler additions, bugfixes, and cleanup</h2>

<ul>
<li>A <code>cfg!</code> syntax extension <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8188">has been
added</a> for conditionally running
code based on crate configuration, similar to what <code>#[cfg]</code> does for
conditional compilation. It expands into a true/false constant, so LLVM
should optimize out the dead branches.</li>
<li>Some more codegen tests <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8165">have been
added</a>.</li>
<li><code>copy</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8162">has been removed as a
keyword</a>.</li>
<li>Static struct initializers <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8091">can now contain
<code>..base</code></a> for functional update.</li>
<li>Take glue <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8146">has been unified</a> for
unique pointer type.</li>
<li>Pointer arithmetic is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8121">now implemented with
GEP</a> rather than casting to int
and back to the pointer.</li>
<li>Some more AST types <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8107">were
renamed</a>.</li>
<li>Cross-crate conditions <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8185">now
work</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Documentation, tools, and other stuff</h2>

<ul>
<li>LLVM assertions <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8147">can now be
disabled</a> with a configure
option.</li>
<li>Benchmarking can <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8111">now be
disabled</a> by passing <code>NO_BENCH=1</code>
to make.</li>
<li><code>NO_REBUILD</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8110">no longer requires a
re-boostrap</a>, which should make
debug cycles on libstd much shorter.</li>
<li><code>vec</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7223">now has module
documentation</a>.</li>
<li>rustpkg <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8032">now handles tags</a>, and
not just version numbers, in the package ID.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Meetings</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Meeting-weekly-2013-07-23">Tuesday
meeting</a> was
quite productive. A quick summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>Graydon wants to investigate using the Memory Pool System as the Rust GC,
rather than a bespoke one. The <a href="http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/">MPS</a> is
a very mature and robust memory management library.</li>
<li>The buildbots now collect and report some metrics as JSON. Take a poke in
<code>http://static.rust-lang.org/build-metrics/&lt;git-sha1&gt;/&lt;builder&gt;/&lt;slave&gt;/&lt;metricsfile&gt;.json</code>
if you&rsquo;re interested.</li>
<li>pcwalton proposes allowing <code>Self</code> in impls, like in trait definitions.</li>
<li>There was some discussion of destructors taking <code>self</code> by value.</li>
<li>There was a proposal to remove <code>*mut</code>, but it can be useful. There was no
consensus.</li>
<li>There was also some discussion on closures and mutable captures. I don&rsquo;t
really have enough context to understand the conversation, something to do
with &ldquo;thunks&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Removing <code>&amp;const</code> was discussed as well. The &ldquo;plan is that we add a lint
flag but document it as a reserved word&rdquo;, as it doesn&rsquo;t really seem to be
useful.</li>
</ul>

overview of Rust and its community. Things are calming down quite a bit, in
that nothing extraordinarily exciting is happening. Lots of great work is
being done everywhere, and good progress is being made in both bugfixes and
cleanup. It has been a good week!</p>

<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking on master?</h1>

<p>Issue churn this week was -15. A total of 59 PRs were merged.</p>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7684">The semantics of <code>range_rev</code> have
changed</a>. This will break your
code without warning.</strong> It is now, to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28mathematics%29#Notations_for_intervals">interval
notation</a>,
<code>(hi, lo]</code> rather than <code>[hi, lo)</code>.</li>
<li><code>pub extern</code> and <code>priv extern</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7896">have been
removed</a> from the language. This
matches the previous similar change to <code>impl</code>. Place the visibility
qualifier (<code>pub</code>/<code>priv</code>) on each item in the <code>extern</code> block instead.</li>
<li><code>&amp;T</code> (besides <code>&amp;'static T</code>) is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7894">no longer allowed in
<code>@T</code></a>.</li>
<li>The <code>ThreadPerCore</code> spawn mode <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7856">has been
removed</a>, as it doesn&rsquo;t make
sense with the new scheduler.</li>
<li>The <code>consume</code> methods of the hash containers <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7833">has been replaced with an
external iterator</a>. The method
name is the same, though.</li>
<li>Moved values can <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7849">no longer be captured
twice</a>. This was a blatant
soundness issue.</li>
<li>The <code>swap_unwrap</code> method of Option has been <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7831">renamed to
<code>take_unwrap</code></a>.</li>
<li><code>debug!</code> statements <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7822">generate no
code</a> unless you pass <code>--cfg
debug</code> to <code>rustc</code>. This should help keep code size down and make your
programs a (tiny bit) faster. Now you don&rsquo;t have to feel bad about having
<code>debug!</code> in hot code.</li>
<li>The <code>mutate_values</code> method of HashMap <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7815">has been
removed</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Notable library additions, bugfixes, and cleanup</h2>

<ul>
<li>An iterator adaptor was added that <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7882">endlessly repeats the iterator it is
called on</a>.</li>
<li>Generated test runners <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7840">now have a
<code>-h</code>/<code>--help</code></a> option.</li>
<li>Metric capturing + racheting <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7829">has been
added</a> for benchmarks.</li>
<li><code>local_data</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7841">now has a
<code>get_mut</code></a> function.</li>
<li><code>extra::semver</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7726">has been updated to SemVer
2.0.0</a>.</li>
<li>Consuming iterators <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7806">have been
added</a> for the hash structures.</li>
<li><code>extra::ringbuf</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7808">now implements
DoubleEndedIterator</a>.</li>
<li><code>Eq</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7799">now has a default implementation of
<code>ne</code></a>.</li>
<li><code>extra::term</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7716">now knows how to handle more
attributes</a>.</li>
<li>More containers <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7788">implement
FromIter</a>. This means you can use
<code>.collect()</code> to gather the elements from an iterator into those containers.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7858">Task killing, failure, and exit code
propagation</a> in the new runtime
has been implemented.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Notable compiler additions, bugfixes, and cleanup</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>syntax::attr</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7902">has been
modernized</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7710">Tons of debuginfo work</a> from mw
this week!</li>
<li>Trait data structures <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7886">have been cleaned
up</a>, as well as a default method
fix.</li>
<li>Intrinsics <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7851">now have much better
codegen</a>.</li>
<li>A <code>no_implicit_prelude</code> attribute <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7844">has been
added</a>, which prevents prelude
injection in the module heirarchy starting at the item which that attribute
is added to.</li>
<li>C-style enum variants are <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7827">now
allowed</a> in <code>[T, ..n]</code>
expressions.</li>
<li>All language items are <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7828">now
optional</a>. The compiler emits an
error if a language item is used but not provided.</li>
<li>The removal of <code>spanned&lt;T&gt;</code> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7826">has
begun</a>.</li>
<li>Headers <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7816">have been removed</a> for
<code>~str</code> and <code>~[T]</code> where <code>T</code> is unmanaged.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Documentation, tools, and other stuff</h2>

<ul>
<li>rustpkg <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7419">now works when you don&rsquo;t give it a package
ID</a>. It builds/installs/cleans
the package in the current directory, <em>iff</em> the current directory is in a
rustpkg workspace.</li>
<li><code>--quiet</code> is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7847">no longer passed</a>
to git during submodule operations, so you can see the progress of the huge
LLVM download.</li>
<li>Documentation of the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7823">lint-controlling
attributes</a> was added.</li>
<li>rustpkg <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7681">now handles cloning from local git
repos</a>.</li>
<li>The GtkSourceView highlighting file <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7795">was
improved</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking on master?</h1>

<p>Issue churn this week was -17! A total of 63 PRs were merged this week, twice
as many as last week. Not bad!</p>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7677">task local storage (TLS)
API</a> was cleaned up (there&rsquo;s
still <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7751">one PR</a> in the queue that
finishes it up).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7652">DList was modernized</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7704"><code>extra::json</code> now uses <code>Iterator&lt;char&gt;</code> rather than a
<code>@Reader</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7117">Various free-standing functions in f32 etc were
removed</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7262">ref bindings in irrefutable patterns has been tightened
up</a>. This potentially fixes <em>and
breaks</em> code. It&rsquo;s breaking because the compiler now rejects incorrect
programs that it did not before.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7612">str no longer encodes invalid
utf-8</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7629"><code>extra::rope</code> was removed</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7594"><code>extra::net_ip</code> and so on were
removed</a>. They were redundant
names for <code>extra::net::ip</code> and such</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7570"><code>Iterator::size_hint</code>&rsquo;s lower bound is no longer an

<h1>Meetings</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Meeting-weekly-2013-07-09">Tuesday
meeting</a> was
all about split stacks and FFI. It&rsquo;s complex and above my ability to
summarize, but from what I can tell no real consensus was made. But, it&rsquo;s the
best enumeration of all the various issues surrounding split stacks that I&rsquo;ve
seen.</p>

    <updated>2013-07-06T15:45:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://cmr.github.io/blog/2013/07/06/this-week-in-rust</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome to the fifth issue of <em>This Week in Rust</em>, a weekly overview
of Rust and its community.</p>

<p><code>0.7</code> was released this week. Hello to the newcomers! I&rsquo;ve also decided to put
breaking changes first. Feel free to skip the rest, it&rsquo;s relatively
unimportant.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Newcomers</h1>

<p>There&rsquo;s already a lot of traffic from Rust newbies, so you get your own
section! Welcome to Rust. I wrote <a href="http://cmr.github.io/blog/2013/07/05/the-state-of-rust/">The State of Rust
0.7</a> especially for
newcomers, so you should read that. Jump on IRC if you have any questions or
need help. We&rsquo;re a quite friendly bunch, and we usually don&rsquo;t bite.</p>

<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking on master?</h1>

<p>Issue churn this week was +12. 35 PRs were merged, total PR churn was -8.
There continues to be a lot more cleanup than breaking changes, which is
encouraging! As I understand it, graydon wants to focus this release cycle on
cleanup, rather than language features. Hopefully the compiler can get into a
much better state.</p>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>dbaupp <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7487">continues</a> to
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7566">slaughter</a> the free functions in
<code>std::vec</code> where methods can replace them.</li>
<li>He also <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7523">added a lint for lowercase
statics</a>, which is enabled by
default because of an astoundingly poor error message.</li>
<li>Seldaek <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7474">moved a bunch of iter
stuff</a> to <code>extra</code>.</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7521">#7521</a>). They are entirely
unused, they just need to be removed and the fallout fixed throughout the
compiler.</li>

<h1>Meetings</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Meeting-weekly-2013-07-02">Tuesday meeting</a>
featured more discussion about <code>@</code> and <code>@mut</code>, that was honestly over my head
(as most of the type system stuff is). If someone wants to write some more
here, feel free to email me (<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x63;&#111;&#x72;&#x65;&#x79;&#x2b;&#x62;&#x6c;&#x6f;&#x67;&#x40;&#x6f;&#x63;&#x74;&#97;&#121;&#x6e;&#46;&#x6e;&#101;&#116;">&#x63;&#111;&#114;&#101;&#121;&#43;&#98;&#108;&#x6f;&#x67;&#x40;&#x6f;&#99;&#116;&#97;&#x79;&#110;&#46;&#x6e;&#x65;&#x74;</a>) a paragraph or two.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Given the influx of newcomers from the 0.7 release, I thought it&rsquo;d be a good
idea to summarize the condition of Rust, its libraries, and its documentation.
bstrie said it best I think, &ldquo;basically, any question of the form &lsquo;is there a
reason for this stupid and terrible thing&rsquo; is &lsquo;no, sorry, we&rsquo;re working on
it&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Iterators</h1>

<p>External iterators are a main feature of the 0.7 release, and there is ongoing
work to remove all of the library features that use internal iterators. Most
of them are gone, and there are few uses of internal iterators. However, they
are clunky to use. The <code>for</code> loop semantics are going to change from internal
iteration to external iteration, but they are still internal iteration right
now, which means the <code>advance</code> adaptor is necessary for most uses of
iterators. Additionally, the <code>iter()</code> helper function is necessary to actually
return an iterator. This will be obviated by an <code>Iterable</code> trait that many
things will hopefully implement. Due to
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/5898">5898</a>, many methods are oddly
named or have an underscore appended (ie, <code>transform</code> instead of <code>map</code>,
<code>position_</code> instead of <code>position</code>).</p>

<h1>IO</h1>

<p>IO has been a bit of a losing proposition since at least 0.2. The interface is
very primitive and inefficient. It requires using <code>@Trait</code> objects (<code>@Reader</code>
/ <code>@Writer</code>). It&rsquo;s also very undocumented. But the situation isn&rsquo;t going to
improve much because all of that code is getting torn out when brson/the
interns finish their work on the new runtime. On the plus side, we&rsquo;ll have
shiny new IO when they&rsquo;re done! If you want to contribute, there&rsquo;s plenty of
work to be done in this area:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/6169">issue 6169</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/6850">issue 6850</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/4419">issue 4419</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2013-May/004305.html">brson&rsquo;s status report for June</a></li>
</ul>


<h1>Compiler</h1>

<p>The compiler is still buggy and inefficient. Lots of things work, but lots of
things don&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s still some resolve bugs (the one mentioned above, as
well as some others, and perpetually poor error messages), default methods
don&rsquo;t work, debuginfo is incomplete, the compiler has quadratic codegen when
using <code>match</code>, so on and so forth. There&rsquo;s a lot of work to be done here but
it&rsquo;s not easy. I&rsquo;m writing a series about the compiler that should help new
contributors get started and grok how it all fits together. The only thing
making Rust usable right now is LLVM&rsquo;s fantastic optimization. Our no-opt
builds run slower than our opt builds under Valgrind. Ponder that for a
minute.</p>

<h1><code>rustpkg</code></h1>

<p>rustpkg is still heavily in-progress and unfinished. It&rsquo;s usable, but not
everything is implemented, and the documentation is incomplete. It&rsquo;s rather
unintuitive to use right now, but it does work! Read the
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/doc/rustpkg.md">manual</a> carefully
if you want to use it.</p>

<h1>Documentation</h1>

<p>Documentation is poor. <code>rustdoc</code> is really bad, which doesn&rsquo;t help. I&rsquo;m
working on a new rustdoc (<a href="http://rustlog.octayn.net">I log my progress
here</a>), but it won&rsquo;t be ready for some weeks. Lots
of things are undocumented or near impossible to find because of how bad
<code>rustdoc</code> is. The tutorials need lots of work, and a guided tour of the
libraries would be nice, as well as a &ldquo;Rust By Example,&rdquo; showing how to
accomplish common goals. These aren&rsquo;t really hard to do, it&rsquo;s just that nobody
has done them yet.</p>

<h1>Libraries</h1>

<p>There are few robust libraries or bindings to libraries, for anything, besides
what is in std/extra. There&rsquo;s the stuff servo uses (glfw, skia, sdl), and an
opengl binding somewhere, but beyond that, you&rsquo;re on your own. The
<a href="https://github.com/crabtw/rust-bindgen">rust-bindgen</a> tool can help with
wrapping a C library. There is no GUI library available yet, no real
networking. It&rsquo;s easy to wrap a C library, you just need to be careful with
your <code>unsafe</code> blocks. Once again, these things aren&rsquo;t hard, they just haven&rsquo;t
been done yet.</p>

<h1>The future</h1>

<p>Basically everything is heavily WIP, but it&rsquo;s constantly improving. We always
need more contributors, ask in IRC if you&rsquo;re interested. Rust 0.7 is pre-alpha
quality, IMO. It would be silly to use Rust for something important, but don&rsquo;t
let that stop you from trying to do something ambitious. If you feel Rust is
still too young to get involved, but you want to track its progress, I write
<a href="http://cmr.github.io/blog/categories/this-week-in-rust/">This Week in Rust</a>,
which is an easy way to track our progress. 1.0 is tentatively planned for
first-quarter 2014, last I heard, and I don&rsquo;t think that is out of reach. 1.0
corresponds to &ldquo;maturity #2&rdquo; at the absolute minimum (the maturiy levels are
listed <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/milestones">as milestones</a>).</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t be discouraged. It was far worse before! Rust is in a good position,
it&rsquo;s just not quite all there yet. This post may seem pessimistic, but the
progress Rust has made is astonishing. Here&rsquo;s to a wonderful 0.8!</p>

    <updated>2013-06-30T16:03:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://cmr.github.io/blog/2013/06/30/structure-and-organisation-of-rustc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This is the second part of a planned series about <code>rustc</code>, the Rust compiler</em></p>

<p><strong>Consider this a work in progress until you don&rsquo;t see this warning anymore</strong>
I&rsquo;ll be updating/adding/amending stuff, but I&rsquo;m publishing what I have in the
hope that it&rsquo;s useful in the interim.</p>

<p>This post is going to discuss the structure and organisation of <code>rustc</code>,
covering the major moving parts and how they interact. I&rsquo;ll start, of course,
where it starts, and ending, of course, where it ends.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><code>rustc</code> is a fairly large, complex beast. Unless otherwise mentioned, all
paths are relative to <code>src/librustc</code>. If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with Rust, a
&ldquo;crate&rdquo; is a compilation unit: a library or an executable.</p>

<h2>Beginning</h2>

<p>The entry point, <code>run_compiler</code> in <code>rustc.rs</code>, does argument parsing, using
<code>extra::getopts</code> and calls into the driver, in <code>driver/driver.rs</code>, which
coordinates the various pieces of the compiler and the rest of the argument
parsing. The key data structure here is the <code>Session</code>, which you can find
(along with a bunch of other things like the option context) in
<code>driver/session.rs</code>. Back to the driver, the function <code>compile_input</code> is where
most of the magic happens. This function runs all the various passes over the
crate. It starts with parsing and macro expansion and moves onto various
static analysis of the code to make sure it is correct, finally generating
LLVM IR (intermediate representation), running LLVM optimizations, and linking
the final binary.</p>

<h2>An interlude</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with compilers, you might find this process a
labyrinthine fractal of complexity. Which it is, don&rsquo;t get me wrong. But the
various pieces of the rust compiler are fairly well separated, even if they
are complex. The basic structure of a compiler is operations on a tree data
structure representing the crate called an AST or Abstract Syntax Tree. An AST
is the output of parsing, and everything in the compiler is transforms or
analysis of this tree. Once everything is done, it takes this AST and
translates it into LLVM IR. This is probably the most hairy part of the
compiler, and it lives in <code>middle/trans</code>. LLVM IR is a representation of code
that the LLVM library can operate on to optimize and generate native machine
code. LLVM does most of the heavy lifting that a traditional compiler would
need to do (optimization and codegen), so the rest of <code>rustc</code> is largely
dedicated to actually dealing with Rust programs.</p>

<h2>Parsing + expansion</h2>

<p>Parsing and macro expansion happen in <code>src/libsyntax</code>, so all paths in this
section will be relative to that. This corresponds to <code>phase_1_parse_input</code>
and <code>phase_2_configure_and_expand</code>. Phase 1 does the parsing, and results in
an AST. If you want, you can look into <code>parse/parser.rs</code> for the
<code>parse_crate_mod</code> method. Very rarely will one have to modify the parser. The
most important part of the parser, from an outsider&rsquo;s perspective, is in
<code>codemap.rs</code>. The codemap has the concept of a &ldquo;span&rdquo;, which is a piece of
source code, represented by a start and an end. Whenever you see an error and
a squiggly line underneath where the error happenes, that is the result of a
span. Almost everything in the AST has a span.</p>

<p>After phase 1 comes, of course, phase 2. Phase 2 is what does macro expansion,
deriving implementations, and removal of items which are conditionally
included with the <code>cfg</code> attribute. This all happens in the <code>ext</code> directory.
Personally I haven&rsquo;t poked around too much at how macros work, but things to
note are <code>cfg.rs</code>, <code>asm.rs</code>, <code>ifmt.rs</code>, and the <code>deriving</code> directory. These do
<code>cfg!</code>, <code>asm!</code>, <code>format!</code> (and friends), and <code>#[deriving(...)]</code>,
respectively.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re curious how a syntax extension works, <code>env.rs</code> is a good example. In
the <code>expand_env</code> function, it takes the syntax extension context (cx), a
span of the macro invocation, and the &ldquo;token tree&rdquo; that the macro was invoked
with.  When you do <code>foo!(....)</code>, the <code>....</code> is the token tree. It checks the
structure of the token tree (it expects either one or two arguments), and then
returns the environment variable referenced by constructing an <code>ast::Expr</code>,
using the ExtCtxt to mark that the expression came from the given span. This
is so the compiler can track which span a piece of macro-generated code
initially came from, for better error reporting.</p>

<p>You might notice that phase 2 actually runs the configuration step twice. This
is so that macros that expand to items with a <code>cfg</code> attribute also get removed
from the final output.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>Phase 3, the analysis phases, is the real meat of rustc. All of this code
lives in <code>middle</code>. The most important passes are probably typeck, the type
checker; resolve, the name resolver; borrowck, the borrow checker; and lint,
the lint runner. Not to say the other passes aren&rsquo;t important, but they&rsquo;re
less frequently worked or worried about by mere mortals such as myself.</p>

<h2>Trans(lation)</h2>

<p>trans is the part of the compiler that takes the AST from syntax as
well as the tables created by analysis and outputs LLVM IR. All of this
happens in <code>middle/trans</code>. There is a lot of code, and I&rsquo;ve never actually
been able to figure out which piece generates what.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s my basic overview of how the compiler is structured. If you want
something added, or as questions get asked, I&rsquo;ll fill in more information. The
analysis and trans sections are sparse as I&rsquo;ve little experience with them.</p>

    <id>http://cmr.github.io/blog/2013/06/29/this-week-in-rust</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome to the fourth issue of <em>This Week in Rust</em>, a weekly overview of Rust and its community.</p>

<p><code>0.7</code> is being cut soon (today, I think). There are preliminary release notes <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.txt">on
GitHub</a>. The tree has been quite calm, with regards to
breakage. Cycle time is still high, but at least when things land they don&rsquo;t break master.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking on master?</h1>

<p>Issue churn this week was -1. Yay! Issue churn this month was -47. 61 people pushed 1,080 commits, changing 2,117 files
and adding a total of 53347 lines.  The top 10 committers were pcwalton, brson, dbaupp, strcat, bblum, nmatsakis,
acricto, Blei, me (cmr), and aatch.</p>

<p>Much of the work this week was cleanup or rebases of older PRs that just hadn&rsquo;t made it in yet.</p>

<h2>Notable additions, bugfixes, and cleanup</h2>

<ul>
<li>Eridius has finished (I think!) the last bit of UNIX <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7436">terminal support</a>,
adding fallback and smarter detection. It should work in 8-color terminals now too.</li>
<li>pcwalton <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7451">rewrote each_path</a>, with the goal of future performance
enhancements.</li>
<li>tjc has done a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7397">bunch</a> of
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7403">rustpkg</a> work.</li>
<li>aatch did some <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7272">trans cleanup</a>.</li>
<li>gifnksm added <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7414"><code>max_by</code> and <code>min_by</code></a> methods to <code>IteratorUtil</code> for getting
the largest/smallest value in an iterator given a score function.</li>
<li>brson got a fix that <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7111">releases large stacks</a> after they are used to lower
memory usage.</li>
<li>mw has a bunch of <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7432">debuginfo</a> work, as well as <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7255">docs and
cleanup</a>.</li>
<li>Blei did an <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7254">intrinsic overhaul</a>.</li>
<li>acrichto implemented <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7291"><code>static mut</code></a>, for globals. Using them requires
unsafe code.</li>
<li>DaGenix <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7207">cleaned up and extended</a> the SHA code.</li>
<li>acrichto renamed <code>.rc</code> files to <code>.rs</code>. <code>.rc</code> is deprecated and functionally equivalent to <code>.rs</code>, all new code should
use it. He also <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7371">added</a> a <code>warnings</code> lint attribute for enabling/disabling
warnings in bulk.</li>
<li>indutny added <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7257"><code>mman</code> (including <code>mmap</code>)</a> FFI.</li>
<li>dbaupp found a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7297">curious performance win</a> by changing some ordering around,
while also enabling conditionally defined macros and macro expansion to items with <code>#[cfg]</code> attributes.</li>
<li>Luqman <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7410">fixed by-value self</a>.</li>
<li>acrichto expanded the <code>deriving(ToStr)</code> code to use <code>ToStr</code> on fields rather than using <code>fmt!("%?", x)</code>.</li>
<li>Blei <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7214">fixed a lot of problems</a> with owned trait objects (<code>~Trait</code>).</li>
<li>sully has <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7471">landed some default method fixes</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>As usual, <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7274">a</a> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7334">bunch</a>
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7373">of</a> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7319">iterator</a> work.</li>
<li>pcwalton renamed Owned to Send and Const to Freeze, better reflecting their actual semantics.</li>
<li>He also disallowed <code>mut</code> from distributing over bindings. For example, the following code no longer works: <code>let mut
(a, b) = (c, d)</code>.</li>
<li>dbaupp <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7430">converted</a> many vector functions to methods. He has a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7487">second
part</a> in line.</li>
<li>Luqman renamed the <code>finalize</code> method in the <code>Drop</code> trait to <code>drop</code>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Other changes</h2>

<p>bblum did some trait/fn/closure bounds
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7314">here</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7354">here</a>, but I don&rsquo;t really
understand what they do or their significance. He said:</p>

<blockquote><p>it changes the way traits/closures and captured data fulfill kind bounds, so<br/>you can restrict or loosen the requirements instead of having the fixed<br/>defaults of &#8220;can only capture Send things in ~fn/~Trait&#8221;</p><p>one example is that you can add the extra requirement of Freeze, so you can<br/>put existential data inside of ARCs</p><p>see https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/test/run-pass/trait-bounds-in-arc.rs</p><p>http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2013/06/11/data-parallelism-in-rust/<br/>is another, more complicated but less contrived, example for how they would be<br/>useful</p></blockquote>


<h1>Meetings</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Meeting-weekly-2013-06-25">Tuesday meeting</a>
mainly discussed <code>@mut</code> and iterators, as well as some minor 0.7 releng stuff.
I suggest reading the <code>@mut</code> discussion yourself, but essentially it revolves
around it not quite fitting into the language, and that it could be easily
punted to a library. The iterator discussion was not notable.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This is the first part of a planned series about <code>rustc</code>, the Rust compiler</em></p>

<p>I remember first hearing about Rust during the summer of 2011. In fact, I
remember the exact moment. I was at MIT, doing their Junction program. It was
during a seminar about semiconductors. I remember browsing through the source on github,
getting lost, and going home.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Fast forward to two months ago. A <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/13/04/03/1646234/mozilla-and-samsung-collaborating-to-bring-new-browser-engine-to-android">slashdot post</a> appears, bringing Rust
back to the forefront of my consciousness. By this point I&rsquo;d actually gained
some programming chops, gotten a job, etc. I read through the Wikipedia
article, though &ldquo;hey, this looks like it has potential,&rdquo; and forgot about it.</p>

<p>Fast forward a week or two. The <a href="http://www.matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges/">matasano crypto challenges</a> were linked
on HN. &ldquo;Our friend Maciej says these challenges are a good way to learn a new
language, so maybe now&rsquo;s the time to pick up Clojure or Rust.&rdquo; And pick up
Rust I did. Rust was a pretty easy language to get started with, with my
predominantly Python, C, and Lua background. Especially for the crypto
challenges, which start off fairly basic.</p>

<h1>First, some warnings:</h1>

<p>Rust is pre-alpha software. Backwards incompatible changes happen <em>weekly</em>,
either in the libraries, or in the language.  It&rsquo;s probably best to not write
any &ldquo;serious&rdquo; code in Rust right now, unless you plan on fixing it every few
weeks to keep up with the language. The nice part about contributing code to
the compiler is that when someone changes the language or a library, it is
their job to fix the code that uses it.</p>

<p>Make sure to use the <code>master</code> branch, and <strong>use the doc links under &ldquo;Trunk&rdquo;.
It will save you pain.</strong> Nothing is worse than accidentally using the 0.6
documentation and finding that a method has been renamed or removed, and
getting confused when the build fails halfway through.</p>

<p><strong>The Rust compiler is poorly written.</strong> This is an artifact of being written
in Rust, which, as stated, changes rapidly. Some code is very old, and uses
very old idioms, or doesn&rsquo;t use newer language features that would be cleaner
and easier to read. If you notice this, try and fix it! If you notice it, that
means you already more-or-less know what needs to be done to clean it up a
bit. If the change is very invasive, it&rsquo;s probably best to open an issue and
let an experienced dev deal with it. An example of a cleanup is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7315">pull request
7315</a>, which cleaned up indentation
and replaced some <code>if</code>s with <code>match</code>es.</p>

<p>Do not, repeat, <em>not</em>, use the <code>rustc</code> code as a source of &ldquo;how to write
Rust.&rdquo; Almost all of it is bad code. I don&rsquo;t even know where to tell you to
look to find consistently good code.  The upside is that generally reviewers
will catch suboptimal code, and suggest improvements.  <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7207">This pull request, for
example</a>, used some old Rust
idioms, which the reviewers suggested fixes for. So feel free to get
elbow-deep in code without worrying <em>too</em> much about whether the code you&rsquo;re
writing is good or bad. General guidelines: avoid <code>@</code> always, avoid <code>~</code>
usually, use <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code>, handle errors. That will guide you
straight most of the time, and by the time you know when to ignore those, you
probably already know what good Rust code is.</p>

<h1>Getting started</h1>

<p>The first thing I did was, of course, go to the <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">home page</a>. I read the
feature summary (which seemed mostly unchanged from when I first saw it.
Indeed, looking in the wayback machine, it is mostly unchanged). I read the
example, and clicked <a href="http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial.html">&ldquo;tutorial&rdquo;</a> over on the left. I built the compiler
while doing this. There are instructions for building Rust over at <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Note-getting-started-developing-Rust">the wiki</a>.
It&rsquo;s a lot easier to get started if you&rsquo;re using Linux or Mac, though not
impossible on Windows (just a bit more setup and waiting).</p>

<p>The tutorial left me confused and alone, and I&rsquo;m sure it did the same to
you. But it gave me enough information that I could write a base64 encode and
decoder, although I constantly referenced the tutorial. By this point I had
moved on to the second matasano challenge, and I found my first compiler bug:
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/6072">really poor error messages</a>. Of course I had to fix this! Error
messages are easy, right?</p>

<p>Yes and no. With a codebase as large and complex as a compiler, there are many
layers of stuff you need to pick apart to figure out the cause and fix of an
issue. In my case, it was easy, just grep for the error message. The fix,
however, was more complex. I had to figure out how to turn a &ldquo;span&rdquo; (the
compiler&rsquo;s way of matching up an AST node with a chunk of source code) in a
string. Often you&rsquo;ll need to go digging through other files to figure out what
you can do, what data structures there are, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Rust makes this easy!</strong> There are no IDEs or any fancy tools, but Rust
source is insanely <code>grep</code>able. You see a method call like
<code>parser.parse_ident(...)</code>, you just need to grep for <code>fn parse_ident</code>.
Of course, actually understanding what the method does is a whole new can of
worms&hellip;</p>

<h1>Picking an issue to fix</h1>

<p>I think the best way to pick an issue to fix is to fix a bug you encounter
yourself. Ask in IRC about it, often someone will be online that either knows
about it and can point you in the right direction, or at the very least help
reproduce, debug, and sift through the issue trcker.</p>

<p>There is the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues?labels=E-easy"><code>E-easy</code></a>
label on certain issues. This are issues that shouldn&rsquo;t take too much trickery
to get done, though they might take some time to get &ldquo;acclimated&rdquo; to the
codebase. <code>E-easy</code> doesn&rsquo;t mean fast, it means easy. It might be tedius or
take non-trivial amounts of effort, but it shouldn&rsquo;t require overarching
design issues or a lot of knowledge about rust or rust internals.</p>

<p>Documentation always needs writing. Open a random file from libstd or
libextra, look for functions, structs, enums, and traits that aren&rsquo;t
documented. You&rsquo;ll get to see a bunch of Rust code, probably using features
you wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise see writing &ldquo;normal&rdquo; code.</p>

<h1>After you fix it</h1>

<p>Once you fix the issue, open a pull request. See <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">GitHub&rsquo;s
help</a> for how to do
this. If you get stuck or need additional help, jump onto IRC
(<a href="http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&amp;channel=%23rust">webchat</a>)
and ask. Someone will have to review your changes, ask &ldquo;r?
$link_to_pull_request&rdquo; in IRC to expedite the process.</p>

<p>Feel free to ping me (cmr) on IRC if you have any questions or problem.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome to the third issue of <em>This Week in Rust</em>, a weekly overview
of Rust and its community.</p>

<p>It has come to my attention that Github does not categorize some
merged-by-bors pull requests as &ldquo;merged&rdquo; and instead categorizes it as
&ldquo;closed&rdquo;. This skews the numbers and also the PRs that I looked through for
inclusion into twir. I&rsquo;ll no longer be including issue churn/PR numbers, and I
hope I didn&rsquo;t miss any import PRs in the last two issues.</p>

<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking in incoming?</h1>

<p>The last of the tree breakage has been cleaned up. The mysterious stack
corruption was traced down by Blei to occur in jemalloc. It has been disabled
until the real cause of the error is found. A bunch more buildbot
configurations have been turned on for auto, to fend off more breakage. The
tree is open, and aatch got out a new snapshot!</p>

<p>Most of the work this week is cleanup and preparation for 0.7, but since the
tree has been closed (and the extra auto buildbots lengthen the time it takes
for a PR to be tested for the day it has been open), not much has landed these
past few days, but a bunch happened earlier this week.</p>

<h2>Notable additions, bugfixes, and cleanup</h2>

<ul>
<li>doener made compiles faster by emitting less useless copies and allocations
in <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7259">7259</a></li>
<li>aatch landed <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7124">part 1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7182">part
2</a> of his huge trans refactor
effort, which make trans faster and less terrible.</li>
<li>sully got <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7203">default methods</a>
less broken</li>
<li>yichoi landed a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7128">bunch</a> of
Android fixes.</li>
<li>vadimcn has <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7134">fixed debuginfo</a>,
which is super amazing. This makes it a lot easier for the GSoC student (mw)
to get started.</li>
<li>doener has <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7186">fixed</a> some
pathological behavior in how codegen creates cleanup blocks. This makes the
IR better, reducing compile time, and also allowing better optimization,
reducing binary size.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<p>strcat <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7263">continues</a>
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7162">work</a> with iterators. The changes
that landed are vector cleanups. Probably most importantly, the <code>each</code> and
<code>eachi</code> methods are being removed. The <code>eachi</code> removal landed but the <code>each</code>
one broke bors, so it&rsquo;s currently in limbo (<strong>UPDATE</strong> 6/23/2013: it landed).
The current replacement is:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>// each
</span><span class='line'>for your_vec.iter().advance |element| {
</span><span class='line'>  ...
</span><span class='line'>}
</span><span class='line'>// eachi
</span><span class='line'>for your_vec.iter().enumerate().advance |(i, element)| {
</span><span class='line'>  ...
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once the rest of the iterator work is hashed out and lands, it will just be</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>// each
</span><span class='line'>for your_vec |element| {
</span><span class='line'>  ...
</span><span class='line'>}
</span><span class='line'>// eachi
</span><span class='line'>for your_vec.enumerate() |(i, element)| {
</span><span class='line'>  ...
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>although the syntax might be slightly different (<code>for element in your_vec</code> is
my favorite proposal).</p>

<h1>Meetings</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Meeting-weekly-2013-06-18">Tuesday
meeting&rsquo;s</a>
main topics were once fn&rsquo;s and how namespaces work. For once fn&rsquo;s, graydon
says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m concerned with adding new features and I want to see if we can live
without it, I understand it is common,&rdquo; not yet making a decision to include
them in the language.</p>

<h1>Meetups</h1>

<ul>
<li>tjc&rsquo;s pre-talk and talk, &ldquo;Rust: A Friendly Introduction&rdquo; went very well. The
<a href="http://catamorphism.org/Writing/Rust-Tutorial-tjc.pdf">slides</a> are up, and
a recording is coming soon (hopefuly). tjc says the slides aren&rsquo;t as
understanable without the audio of the talk.</li>
<li>nmatsakis has expressed willingness/interest in a Boston meetup sometime. If
you&rsquo;re interested, contact him on IRC or the ML.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome to the second issue of <em>This Week In Rust</em>, a weekly overview
of Rust and its community. I&rsquo;ll be covering what&rsquo;s cooking in incoming,
meeting summaries, meetups, and anything else pertinent.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to stop using real names and use irc/github names, simply because
that is how I, and most everyone, interacts in the community.</p>

<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking in incoming?</h1>

<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of breakage on incoming this week, with jemalloc breaking
32bit cross-compilation as well as random segfaults and stack corruption of
unknown cause.  Some heroics by the core devs have got it mostly cleaned up,
though the tree is still rather chaotic. Meanwhile a handful of performance
improvements have landed, and achricto rewrote <code>rusti</code>.</p>

<p>There were 17 pull requests merged this week. Total issue churn (excludes pull
requests) this week was +2 (this excludes the 38 pull requests that were
closed when incoming was killed).</p>

<h2><code>incoming</code> branch annihilated</h2>

<p>Goodbye <code>incoming</code>, hello <code>master</code>! This change, long in coming, unfortunately
closed all open PRs. Start doing your development against <code>master</code> rather than
incoming.</p>

<h2>Notable additions, bugfixes, and cleanups</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a concerted effort to remove duplicate freestanding functions where
possible.</p>

<ul>
<li>In <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/6986">6986</a> bjz and jensnockert have cleaned up the numeric code some
more, adding methods for existing things like <code>sin</code>, as well as adding a
bunch of interpolation stuff.</li>
<li>steven_is_false added prototype dynamic library loading support in
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7027">7027</a>, which should remove a lot of pain for people looking for
easy dynamic loading. It currently doesn&rsquo;t work on Windows, so if you can
sling Windows code, help would be appreciated!</li>
<li>In <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7029">7029</a> luqmana allows having multiple impl&rsquo;s add static methods,
which previously did not work.</li>
<li>Eridius stepped up to <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7133">fix the terminfo code</a>, colors should be
arriving to more people soon.</li>
<li>SiegeLord <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7077">improved the CSS</a> used by rustdoc with <em>huge</em> improvements.</li>
<li>sully has gotten default methods working for the most part, he is still
testing cross-crate edge casses.</li>
<li>vadimcn <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7134">has fixed debuginfo</a>, and supposedly the GSoC intern is
getting started on improving it next week.</li>
<li>doener has got <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7154">some nice</a> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7144">performance</a> PRs in place.</li>
<li>aatch is working on <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/7124">cleaning up trans</a>. Huge thanks to him!</li>
</ul>


<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>dbaupp and strcat continue their cleanup of the standard library, removing
the ad-hoc iterator functions where <code>std::iterator</code> can replace them.</li>
<li>All of the string functions that could be reasonably converted to methods
have been.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re working in the stdlib, acrichto has toggled most of the lint
settings to &ldquo;deny&rdquo; for std/extra, so watch out.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Meetings</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Meeting-weekly-2013-06-11">Tuesday meeting</a> talked about bblum&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Proposal-for-effects">Effect proposal</a>,
removing the master/incoming split, and &ldquo;alloc expressions&rdquo;, a replacement for
@-sigils.</p>

<p>The consensus on the effect proposal is that it needs investigation and
wouldn&rsquo;t be landing in 1.0.</p>

<p>Discussion about master/incoming mostly centered on &ldquo;master isn&rsquo;t always
green, how can we add better coverage to bors&#8217; tests?&rdquo; Consensus seems to be
that removing incoming would be beneficial, but enabling more OS and valgrind
coverage on bors would harmfully impact development speed.</p>

<p>The proposed syntax for alloc expressions is <code>new (provider) expr</code>, with <code>new
expr</code> becoming the replacement for the current <code>~expr</code>. This would allow
custom smart pointers. pcwalton ended the meeting with a huge cliff hanger</p>

<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to talk a little bit today about simplifying the<br/>mut-borrowing story in regards to this, we may be able to effect a large<br/>simplification on the language</p></blockquote>


<p>Personally, I think <a href="https://gist.github.com/Kimundi/5744578">kimundi&rsquo;s proposal</a> has a lot of promise, and the
syntax is more pleasing to me. It wasn&rsquo;t brought up at the meeting, though.</p>

<h1>Meetups</h1>

<ul>
<li>The Mountain View meetup was a great success. 18 showed up. erickt is
planning for another SF Bay area meetup in July. If you want to give a
presentation, send him your proposal and how long you need to put it
together.</li>
<li>Tim Chevalier will be giving a talk titled &ldquo;Rust: A Friendly Introduction&rdquo;
on Monday, June 17, 6-9pm in Portland. See <a href="http://calagator.org/events/1250464376">Calagator</a> for more
details. This is a preview of a talk he will be giving at <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/970">Open Source
Bridge</a>, also in Portland.</li>
</ul>

    <updated>2013-06-15T08:21:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://cmr.github.io/blog/2013/06/15/a-reflection</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I graduated high school. It was quite a journey and I feel some
reflection is due.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Regrets</h1>

<p>Randy Pausch said &ldquo;It is not the things we do in life that we regret on our
death bed. It is the things we do not.&rdquo; I agree with this. Fortunately, I have
few regrets about high school. I did not party, drink, or drug. I did not
participate in many clubs. I did not make many friends. I did, however, study,
almost constantly. Not for tests or anything academic, as my transcript shows
and my classmates can affirm, but my interests. I have learned more about my
passion, computers, than I ever thought existed when I first got started.</p>

<p>I have not been the most diligent student. Frequently I did not complete my
work. This was probably a bad decision, but I justified it with the (dubiously
attributed) Twain quote, &ldquo;Never let your schooling interfere with your
education,&rdquo; although it was initially laziness combined with depression. As
far back as 4th grade I&rsquo;ve been struggling to keep up with various assignments
(I recall being a few chapters behind in math homework. Mrs. Marrotte made me
stay after school every day until it was finished.) Later on, especially
7th-11th grade, it was hard to rile up motivation to do homework when I could
barely rile up motivation to continue being alive.</p>

<p>By the time I had gone through counseling and started an anti-depressant and
could function like a healthy human, I found I didn&rsquo;t have the skills to do
what needed to be done. I had not had practice or experience doing non-trivial
activities that I did not care about. I continue to struggle with this. It&rsquo;s
part procrastination too, which there&rsquo;s no excuse for. Another Randy Pausch
quote applies here: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always believed that if you took one tenth the
energy you put into complaining and applied it to solving the problem, you&rsquo;d
be surprised by how well things can work out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I don&rsquo;t regret not completing all of my work. Even if I did not finish and
pass in the homework, I did learn the content rather well. I wasn&rsquo;t content
not understanding something (except transcendentalism, but that is its own
story). I regret not making the most of my time in school. I could have been
much more engaged with the community of my peers. I&rsquo;m not sure that I actually
desire that difference, though. Time spent with my peers was instead spent
studying, programming, or playing video games. I graduate with 2 of my close
friends and a handful of good acquaintances (I use &ldquo;friend&rdquo; very reservedly).</p>

<p>I definitely regret not being more involved and dedicated to Destination
Imagination. It&rsquo;s a great program and I feel like I let down my teammates (and
probably frustrated the advisor). This also applies to science club and mock
trial, though to a lesser extent.</p>

<p>I really wish depression hadn&rsquo;t hit me like a train. It was manageable until
9th grade. From there it was a downward spiral of self-hatred, cutting, and
suicidal thoughts (and one attempt sophomore year). I know we are the sum of
our experience, and mine have made me stronger, but I would trade it in in a
heartbeat.</p>

<h1>Thanks</h1>

<p>Beyond teaching the standard curricula, I owe some teachers huge amounts of
thanks (roughly in chronological order):</p>

<ul>
<li>Mrs. Cook for encouraging me to be, as she phrased it, &ldquo;an odd duck.&rdquo; I was
very sad to see her leave after a single year at the school, she was a
good teacher.</li>
<li>Julia Zimmerman and Paul Kreiner (during Junction 2011 at MIT) for so many
reasons. They were constantly encouraging, even when my writing was
terrible. They taught me how appreciate science fiction and all forms of
writing, showing the science behind writing through linguistics.</li>
<li>Mrs. Stroshine for <em>really</em> teaching how to analyze and appreciate usage of
the English language, and also for putting up with me as I finished Junior
English my Senior Year. I procrastinated so much and was actually afraid of
you (although that construction was entirely in my head, you are a very nice
person). You are a fantastic teacher and I hope you enjoy your retirement.</li>
<li>Mr. Smith for his passion for history. It has definitely rubbed off on me,
especially your message that history isn&rsquo;t static, it is constantly open to
reinterpretation as more evidence is presented.</li>
<li>Mr. Fazio for his gentle encouragement and toleration of my (usually
advanced, sometimes off-topic) questions in the middle of his lessons, as
well as not giving up near the end of the year in Senior Math Topics. I did
actually learn in that class.</li>
<li>Dr. Kaplan for fostering a healthy skepticism in me. Your occasional
off-track discussions that you allowed (although never skipping a beat with
the curriculum) throughout our two years were always informative. These will
stick with me longer than how to balance redox reactions.</li>
<li>Ms. Gigliello for understanding me almost uncannily (supposedly her daughter
is just like me. Which is, of course, a good thing). The discussions you
(lightly moderated) during class never failed to engage me. Circle time is a
wonderful invention.</li>
<li>Mr. Dunn for letting me work in his room all the time and for his farewell
address. You are a great asset to the school, and your retirement has
definitely been earned.</li>
</ul>


<p>And finally</p>

<ul>
<li>Mr. Kuhn. You are possibly the best teacher I ever had, especially
considering some of the most important lessons you taught me were outside of
any class I was in. You always challenged me to think creatively and to
stretch beyond myself, but within my means. My biggest regret is not
spending more time with you this year (I felt awful for the DI fiasco, I was
embarrassed to even see you in the hall: an unfounded feeling I know).</li>
</ul>


<p>Not only have you taught me your respective curricula, you have <em>changed the
way I think</em>. Your influence, and my appreciation, can not be overstated. You
do not get paid nearly enough for what you do.</p>

<p>There are some non-teachers that get some love too:</p>

<ul>
<li>Joanne Walsh, who always gave me crap for being late to school. You are an
amazing, patient, kind person. It meant a lot to me to see you at
graduation. Thank you.</li>
<li>Roni Hoffmanm. You were my mom away from home and always made sure I was
behaving as a decent human should. During conversation you called yourself a
&ldquo;peon&rdquo; and a &ldquo;little person.&rdquo; Nothing could be further than the truth. You
are incredibly important and a great role model.</li>
</ul>


<p>I will not miss Monadnock, but I will miss the faculty. The quality of the
teachers is very high. The political changes happening around them are
unfortunate.</p>

<h1>The future</h1>

<p>I will be studying Computer Science at Clarkson University in the fall. I will
not squander my time there like I did my time in high school.</p>

<p>The Rust interns arrived this week and have got cracking right away. Big hello
to Aaron Todd, Ben Blum, and Michael Sullivan! We can look forward to work all
over the place, especially in the RT and debug-info.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>What&rsquo;s cooking in incoming?</h1>

<p>There were 30 pull requests merged this week. A scattering of doc fixes and a
bunch of code cleanups and optimization work as usual. Total issue churn
(excludes pull requests) this week was +6.</p>

<h2>Notable additions, bugfixes, and cleanups</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ben Striegel added the <code>as_c_str</code> string function as a method as part of the
overall methodization covered by <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/6045">6045</a>.</li>
<li>James Miller landed a much better optimization pipeline in <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/6881">6881</a>,
fixing a bunch of nascent optimization problems, especially with inlining,
and also fixing an earlier (huge) regression (that he introduced,
admittedly).</li>
<li>James also fixed <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/6977">6977</a>, which allowed nonsensical expressions like <code>[0,
..-1]</code>. Whoops!</li>
<li>I introduced terminfo handling to <code>extra::term</code> in <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/6826">6826</a>, bringing
rustc&rsquo;s beautiful colors to a wider audience.  Unfortunately, it isn&rsquo;t
complete yet and, most notably, does not handle <code>xterm-256color</code> correctly
yet.</li>
<li>Daniel Micay landed jemalloc as the default allocator in the runtime,
leading to nice allocation performance boosts on all platforms, as well as
much improved multithreaded performance. It also has the benefit of
cross-platform tuning and instrumentation.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<p>It would be silly not to mention these changes, even though they weren&rsquo;t
strictly this week:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>libcore</code> was renamed to <code>libstd</code> and <code>libstd</code> was renamed to <code>libextra</code>, to
better reflect their purpose. Confusingly, the code in rustc still uses the
old names. Something to watch out for!</li>
<li>All of the module reexports were removed from the prelude, so if you use,
for example, <code>io::foo</code>, <code>vec::foo</code>, etc, you will find yourself having to
add a lot of extra imports. <code>use std::*</code> to regain the old behavior,
more or less.</li>
<li>Patrick fixed the unsafe checker to safe code can no longer call unsafe
methods.</li>
</ul>


<p>This week:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>pub impl</code> was removed by Patrick Walton as part of <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/6944">6944</a>. What
this did was have all <code>fn</code>s in a <code>pub impl</code> be <code>pub</code> by default. Now, you
must explicitly specify <code>pub</code> on all <code>fn</code>s in the impl if you want them
public.</li>
<li>Also in <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/6944">6944</a>, Patrick removed the ability to have multiple
patterns appear in &ldquo;let&rdquo; declarations. For example: <code>let a = 4, b = 2;</code>
becomes <code>let (a, b) = (4, 2);</code></li>
<li>Daniel renamed the <code>Ptr</code> trait to <code>RawPtr</code> in <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/6913">6913</a></li>
<li>Daniel and Huon Wilson have been working on iterators a lot. In
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/6999">6999</a>, they start removing the <code>vec::each_*</code> functions, as the new
iterator code in <code>std::iterator</code> is now mature enough for use.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Meetings</h1>

<p>There were two main meetings this week. Mostly discussion about DST, closures,
and the GC. Lots of issues and details remain to be worked out, I suspoect it
will still be a bit before anything final-looking comes up in a PR. See the
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Meeting-weekly-2013-06-04">meeting</a> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Meeting-2013-06-07">notes</a> for more details.</p>

<h1>Meetups</h1>

<ul>
<li>Erick Tryzelaar has a meetup planned in Mountain View on Wednesday, June 12,
at 7pm. See the <a href="https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2013-June/004356.html">ML thread</a> for more details.</li>

<ul>
<li>10gen has some interns working on a MongoDB driver for Rust, which will be
very nice to have. Good luck to them!</li>
<li>Brendan Zabarauskas has fixed <code>lmath</code>. It now works on incoming. Yay!</li>
</ul>


<p>Brendan sent in a correction:</p>

<blockquote><p>Unfortunately whilst it builds on incoming, due to a bug you can&#8217;t use it in<br/>external crates. moonchrome and I am are working on fixing this but it will<br/>require us to remove the trait heirachy and use macros to generate each type<br/>(Vec3f, Vec3f32, &#8230; etc.) individually instead. Integer and Boolean vector<br/>types (present in GLSL) will also be removed.</p></blockquote>
